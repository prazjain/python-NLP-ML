The company wants to power mobile robotics through AI and machine learning, rather than sensors and hand-coded rules. Co-founder and CEO Amar Shah explained, “As computational power and data continue to grow, learning-based approaches will become more inevitable, especially for mobile robotics. The human brain has evolved over millions of years, computers have only had a few decades, but are catching up quickly.” \\n\\nWith this approach to autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars could better navigate unfamiliar and difficult roads. In fact, this past spring, Wayve tested a self-driving car navigating on roads it had never been on before. The navigation was guided by cameras, a 2D map, and the startup’s end-to-end, deep learning “driving brain.”\\n\\n“The average human learns to drive in just 50 hours with visual input primarily. Once we have learned, we are capable at driving on roads around the world despite vastly differing traffic laws and cultural context,” said Suranga Chandratillake, partner at Balderton Capital. “Wayve’s self-driving technology is the closest to this human approach to learning. The great advantage of solving the problem this way is that it is robust in the face of a global opportunity.”\\n\\nNow the company will test its approach in one of the world’s busiest cities. Wayve will release a fleet of vehicles in central London for controlled trials; the start date was not disclosed.\\n\\nLaunched in Cambridge and currently based in London, Wayve reports it is the first European self-driving car company to snag a Silicon Valley VC to lead a Series A.\\n\\nSeth Winterroth, partner at Palo Alto-based Eclipse Ventures, commented: “Wayve’s differentiated approach to autonomy builds on timely advances in the fields of reinforcement learning, simulation and computer vision. Furthermore, by locating the company in the UK, the team has access to an extraordinary talent pool and numerous complex testing environments.”',\n",

This is the UK firm’s ninth fund since its founding in 1996.\\n\\nWith Northzone IX, the firm wants to help conventional industries innovate beyond legacy technology, sectors such as financial services, healthcare, education, mobility and construction. Investments will continue to go toward consumer and enterprise companies across Europe and the eastern coast of the US, focusing primarily on Series A and B rounds. The fund has already made three investments, in Pollen (London), Spacemaker (Oslo) and Livepeer (NYC).\\n\\nNorthzone is particularly proud that many members of its team have founded their own companies at one point. With the launch of the new fund, Hello Fresh co-founder Jessica Schultz and Dots co-founder Paul Murphy have been promoted to General Partners, alongside Pär-Jörgen Pärson, Jeppe Zink, and Michiel Kotting.\\xa0 Jessica Schultz said: “We have always stood behind strong-minded founders with the ambition to think big and the conviction to build transformative businesses. This latest fund puts us in a strong position, together with our collective experience as investors, founders and operators, to back early-stage founders with the greatest potential.” Paul Murphy added: “The start-up ecosystems beyond Silicon Valley have seen a step change in recent years in quality, scale and an abundance of experienced founder and operator talent, along with deeper pockets of capital. There has never been a better time for tech entrepreneurs in Europe.”',\n",

Indeed, along with the Series A, the company has announced a new deep technology called “Federate,” for which it has just filed several patents.\\n\\nCo-founder and Chief Product Officer Dr. Giovanni Tummarello explained the value of the technology: “Siren stands at the forefront of augmented analytics, the new wave of analytics in which AI techniques give analysts unprecedented powers of investigation. In Siren, techniques like knowledge graph/link analysis, entity resolution, search, natural language processing and predictive analytics seamlessly come together in a single UI. Siren is easy to deploy and leverages data directly on backends such as Elasticsearch, relational databases, virtual data warehouses and graph databases.”\\n\\nCEO John Randles said: “The demand for investigative intelligence and large-scale interconnected data analysis is constantly accelerating. Our platform uniquely enables this in real-time at a scale that companies and government organizations require. In this sector it is critical to not only raise funds, but also to have the right wealth of experience. For this reason, we’re delighted to have Bob Griffin join the board.”\\n\\nCurrently with DVI Equity Partners, Griffin is a veteran of intelligence and law enforcement software and former CEO of i2, which was acquired by IBM to become the world’s most deployed intelligence and law enforcement software.\\n\\nGriffin commented: “We believe Siren is a pioneer in a market that is about to explode. We are pleased to support their ongoing success and become part of a journey that will see investigative intelligence technologies shape the future direction of law enforcement, cyber security and financial fraud.” Gerry Maguire of Atlantic Bridge remarked on how the investment will propel the business forward: “The latest round of funding will enable Siren to further develop its proposition and expand into new markets, consolidating its position as an industry leader. Siren is revolutionizing the augmented analytics field, creating unprecedented value especially for organizations with large real-time data.”',\n",
       " 'Thing-it, the German proptech building a digitalisation platform for smart buildings, has raised\\xa0 €4.2 million in growth capital, co-led by PropTech1 Ventures and coparion. The startup wants to provide tools for efficient control and collaboration when it comes to property management in the IOT age.\\n\\nOffice buildings around the world already contain 1.3 billion connected devices, which is projected to 3.3 billion by 2022. These devices and modern sensors offer a ton of information and control over smart offices, co-working spaces, intelligent city quarters, and general facility management. Modern sensors can, for example, be used to cost-effectively determine room occupancy and optimize building use. Conditions of the room can be controlled remotely, such as shading, lighting, adaptive heating and cooling, even improved air circulation with savings of up to 30%. But to wield that control, there needs to be a central operating system.\\n\\nBased in Bad Homburg, Thing-it has developed a SaaS platform that serves as a “brain” for all the data and functions firing around an IOT-equipped office. Owners, tenants, employees, and facility managers can interact with each other, book rooms, and control access to certain areas. \\n\\nThanks to a growing network of hardware-, integration-, and operating partners, Thing-it’s platform can be individualized to a customer’s requirements. Projects so far include cube berlin and The Ship in Cologne.\\n\\nFounder and CEO Dr. Marc Gille-Sepehri said, “We have already shown in production what a wide range of functionality and value chains our digitalization platform can support in commercial real estate. The current financing round helps us to roll out this functionality to a broader market together with our partners.” \\n\\nNikolas Samios of PropTech1 Ventures commented, “Buildings are becoming more and more connected. This entails various potentials, but at the same time often enormous complexity, which classic real estate developers and, for example, at a later stage also facility managers can barely handle in their operations. Only through smart middleware such as Thing-it can digital real estate be mastered beyond glamorous showcase projects in the mass market.” ',\n",
       " 'Glue Collaboration, the Helsinki-based VR-driven collaboration platform, has raised a €3.5 million seed round led by Maki.vc. Other investors include Reaktor Innovations, Bragiel Brothers, and Foobar Technologies. Business Finland, the Finnish funding agency for technology and innovation, and OP Bank also participated. Glue is a cloud-based platform that facilitates virtual meetings between people around the world, bringing them together in a three-dimensional virtual space that’s completely customizable to the group. The experience is designed to serve as a powerful alternative to expensive physical face-to-face meetings and lackluster audio or video calling systems. The company, which began 15 years ago as an award-winning animation, XR and gaming studio and morphed into Glue in 2017, believes effective team collaboration requires not just communication but also the immersive feeling of “true presence” with other colleagues. In fact, Glue has just announced a new showcase of Microsoft security solutions in tandem with MacWell Creative, specifically an interactive, worldwide “escape room”-like VR experience called Intersection. Intersection brings together up to five participants in a shared virtual space to solve various cybersecurity puzzles and hacks in a race against the clock. Glue CEO Jussi Havu said: “We’re excited to partner with MacWell Creative on this concept, which serves as an excellent demonstration of what’s now possible from immersive 3D virtual spaces. When you enter Intersection, you interact with others as if you were face-to-face – there’s a true sense that you’re there with your teammates in the same physical space. That makes for high-quality collaboration as well as the much better rate of recall and retention that comes from learning by doing.” Commenting on the investment, Havu continued: “We are delighted that this group of leading technology investors believe in Glue and share our vision. We are now well positioned to accelerate the commercial phase of our growth and help organizations do business in a more productive and sustainable way.” Ilkka Kivimäki, partner at Maki.vc, said: “Providing the optimal setting for effective virtual collaboration is no easy undertaking, but we are excited about the progress Glue has made. The result is a platform that offers enormous potential for businesses serious about reducing travel and cutting their carbon footprint.”',\n",
       " 'Snowplow Analytics, a London-based startup that helps businesses collect and own their customer data, has closed a £4 million funding round from research-led VC firm MMC Ventures. Motivated from their own frustration when trying to use legacy analytics tools, Alexander Dean and Yali Sassoon founded Snowplow in 2012. The result is an open-source platform that enables companies to collect their own customer behavioural data across their entire digital estates. Dean, now CEO, explained: “Snowplow was founded with the aim of freeing data teams from the constraints imposed by traditional analytics vendors. Every industry now has its ‘Amazon’, ‘AirBnB’ or ‘Uber’: a determined tech or product-led disruptor that is using data to drive insights. In this new world, there’s an increased demand for organisations to become much more data-informed. Snowplow helps data teams build that strategic foundation for their customer data. Snowplow has over 150 customers across a broad range of sectors and geographies, including Strava, La Presse The Economist, Weebly, Hudl, Auto Trader, Omio and Secret Escapes. The funding will support the company’s continued expansion in the US and Europe and further product development. Commenting on the investment, Dean continued: “It’s fantastic to have the MMC Ventures team on board as our first VC investor. Ollie and the team showed huge engagement with our product and real enthusiasm for what we’re doing, so it felt an obvious, natural fit. We’re excited to see how their support will spur us on in this next phase of growth.” Oliver Richards, investment director at MMC Ventures, said: “Having experienced the limitations of traditional analytics solutions first-hand, Alex and the team have demonstrated a real understanding of their customers’ pain-points, which is obvious in their impressive roster of clients across a huge range of sectors. Needless to say, we’ve been very impressed with how Snowplow has grown its team and technology organically without funding to this point, and we’re delighted to be central to the next exciting stage of growth.”',\n",

       " 'EQT Ventures has closed its second fund, EQT Ventures II, at €660 million, with the plan to support ambitious European companies scale out of the continent and also to help US founders scale in. Bridging Europe and the US, the Swedish firm will use its proprietary AI system Motherbrain to identify nascent success and make investments accordingly.\\n\\nAs with its first fund, EQT Ventures will invest early, typically Series A or B, with European startups and a bit later, Series B or C, with American companies who are looking to expand into Europe. It’s worth noting, though, that the firm uses the verb “partner” rather than “invest,” as it sees its work with portfolio companies as much more than providing capital. Operational support and advice are offered through different stages of growth, covering product, marketing and communications, engineering, analytics, UX, international expansion, sales, partnerships, and finance.\\n\\nThe selection process is powered by Motherbrain, which is run like a startup within EQT and garnered its own dedicated team in 2016. The system processes data about millions of companies every day, feeding the firm insight and informing decisions at every step of the investment funnel. Five EQT Ventures’ portfolio companies have been sourced by Motherbrain so far: Peakon, Handshake, AnyDesk, Warducks, and Standard Cognition.\\n\\nHjalmar Winbladh, Partner and Investment Advisor to the EQT Ventures funds, said: “Building a global success story is tough and requires more than just capital. It requires grit, ambition, teamwork and support from people who’ve experienced the start-up journey firsthand. This is where the EQT Ventures team can help and, with a large multi-stage fund, we can support and coach entrepreneurs on their journeys for longer so they can scale and deliver long-term, sustainable growth. Europe has never lacked ambition, talent or innovation but compared with the US, European start-ups have often struggled to access the capital they needed to grow from bright ideas into proven businesses. With this fund, EQT Ventures wants to continue to help close this funding gap and the fund’s size is clear evidence of the growing confidence in European tech, which is punching above its weight. The EQT Ventures team is looking forward to partnering with the boldest founders in Europe and the US, determined to build global winners.”\\n\\nEQT and its second fund both have global ties. In addition to its Stockholm headquarters, the firm has offices in London, San Francisco, Amsterdam, and Berlin. The new fund is backed by a global blue-chip investor base consisting of pension funds, insurance companies, financial institutions, foundations, family offices, and others, based in Europe, the US, and Asia.

       " 'Let’s Do This, an online marketplace for endurance sporting events, has announced a $15 million Series A round, led by the EQT Ventures with participation from existing investors NFX, Y Combinator, Richard Oldfield, and Paddy Dear. \\n\\nUniversity of Cambridge graduates Alex Rose and Sam Browne, wanted to solve their own challenges and annoyances when it came to finding and registering in sporting events and races. The platform they’ve built does this and more. \\n\\nLet’s Do This has information about 30,000 races around the world, of all types and distances, with hard-to-find details and exclusive booking perks for its members. These include free cancellation protection, which lets people pull out of a race if they’ve got an injury or simply cold feet.\\n\\nBeyond facilitating and fail-safing the registration process, Let’s Do This also wants to encourage people to live healthier, more active lives. In fact, the company’s recent $5 million seed round, led by NFX, got investments from professional athletes such as Usain Bolt, Serena Williams and Paula Radcliffe. \\n\\nSerena Williams commented on the latest funding: “I’ve seen first-hand the incredible impact these events can have on making people fitter, healthier and happier. I love that Let’s Do This is not only making events like these more accessible, but also helping to support athletes of all different fitness levels. Women are especially less likely to participate in marathons and obstacle races, so it’s really important there’s a platform encouraging people to step out of their comfort zones and make a positive difference in their lives.”\\n\\nWith the fresh funding, Let’s Do This will expand the team across its San Francisco and London offices. Lyle Fong of EQT Ventures will join the board. “Lyle and EQT Ventures will be crucial to ensuring we achieve our mission of inspiring more epic experiences than any other community on the planet. We couldn’t be more excited for them to be joining the team,” said Sam Browne, co-founder and CEO at Let’s Do This. “I’ve spent a great deal of time with Lyle over the last 12 months and his deep product expertise and clear vision for how we can fundamentally improve people’s daily lives will take us to the next level. We’re fanatical about ensuring anyone joining the team shares our intensity and long term commitment to our mission; Lyle and the whole EQT Ventures team have consistently shown us that they live by these same values.”\\n\\n“Perhaps not surprisingly given the space, the Let’s Do This team is one of the most hyper-competitive and driven teams I’ve met,” said Lyle. “They are tackling a rapidly growing $30bn market for endurance challenges, which has generally been low-tech and fragmented. Sam, Alex and the team attacks this problem with the same mentality and determination as they do when they were winning world-class events. I would hate to have to compete with them!”',\n",
       " 'cnvrg.io, the Israeli data science platform bringing auto-adaptive machine learning to enterprise, has closed both seed and Series A rounds, totaling $8 million of funding in the last year. The seed round was led by Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP), the Series A by Hanaco VC.\\n\\nThe investments allow the Jerusalem-based startup to open a new office in New York City and double-down on research and development, both of which support the “overwhelming demand” for the product.\\n\\ncnvrg.io, founded by Leah Kolben and Yochay Ettun, has created an end-to-end platform that helps global enterprises adopt machine learning. Many enterprises, stuck in conventional business practices, lack the resources, knowledge and skill sets to rapidly develop and deploy advanced AI technologies. \\n\\nCEO and co-founder Yochay Ettun explained:\\xa0 “As data scientists and AI consultants ourselves, we understand the frustration data scientists, data engineers, and organizations encounter when building machine learning. That is why we started cnvrg.io, to help make the process faster and more efficient, so data scientists and developers can focus on the real magic: algorithms.”\\n\\nLed by data scientists, the cnvrg.io platform is built to manage, unify and accelerate the full machine learning lifecycle, from vision and development, team collaboration and testing, all the way to production, deployment, monitoring and refinement. It has everything a data scientist needs to find and deliver high-impact results. \\n\\n“We had been looking to make an investment into a company that democratizes AI and machine learning for quite some time,” says Pasha Romanovski, Hanaco Ventures co-founding partner. “What really impressed us is how quickly Leah and Yochay built a product to address this market need, recruited an impressive team and onboarded a great group of customers. In a few years, most companies will have a data science team and cnvrg.io is poised to be their platform of choice.”\\n\\nYoav Tzruya, general partner of JVP, added: “Adoption of data science as a competitive edge is a must for today’s data-driven businesses. Companies are frantically seeking solutions, enabling them to rapidly streamline data science processes, automating all aspects, from model development to production, while further addressing the shortage of data scientists. We believe cnvrg.io is the only tool in the market that offers enterprise complete lifecycle management, supporting a wide variety of AI use cases and models, which has the potential to allow organizations to achieve that goal.”',\n",

The company wants to power mobile robotics through AI and machine learning, rather than sensors and hand-coded rules. Co-founder and CEO Amar Shah explained, “As computational power and data continue to grow, learning-based approaches will become more inevitable, especially for mobile robotics. The human brain has evolved over millions of years, computers have only had a few decades, but are catching up quickly.” \\n\\nWith this approach to autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars could better navigate unfamiliar and difficult roads. In fact, this past spring, Wayve tested a self-driving car navigating on roads it had never been on before. The navigation was guided by cameras, a 2D map, and the startup’s end-to-end, deep learning “driving brain.”\\n\\n“The average human learns to drive in just 50 hours with visual input primarily. Once we have learned, we are capable at driving on roads around the world despite vastly differing traffic laws and cultural context,” said Suranga Chandratillake, partner at Balderton Capital. “Wayve’s self-driving technology is the closest to this human approach to learning. The great advantage of solving the problem this way is that it is robust in the face of a global opportunity.”\\n\\nNow the company will test its approach in one of the world’s busiest cities. Wayve will release a fleet of vehicles in central London for controlled trials; the start date was not disclosed.\\n\\nLaunched in Cambridge and currently based in London, Wayve reports it is the first European self-driving car company to snag a Silicon Valley VC to lead a Series A.\\n\\nSeth Winterroth, partner at Palo Alto-based Eclipse Ventures, commented: “Wayve’s differentiated approach to autonomy builds on timely advances in the fields of reinforcement learning, simulation and computer vision. Furthermore, by locating the company in the UK, the team has access to an extraordinary talent pool and numerous complex testing environments.”',\n",

Investments will continue to go toward consumer and enterprise companies across Europe and the eastern coast of the US, focusing primarily on Series A and B rounds. The fund has already made three investments, in Pollen (London), Spacemaker (Oslo) and Livepeer (NYC).\\n\\nNorthzone is particularly proud that many members of its team have founded their own companies at one point. With the launch of the new fund, Hello Fresh co-founder Jessica Schultz and Dots co-founder Paul Murphy have been promoted to General Partners, alongside Pär-Jörgen Pärson, Jeppe Zink, and Michiel Kotting.\\xa0 Jessica Schultz said: “We have always stood behind strong-minded founders with the ambition to think big and the conviction to build transformative businesses. This latest fund puts us in a strong position, together with our collective experience as investors, founders and operators, to back early-stage founders with the greatest potential.” Paul Murphy added: “The start-up ecosystems beyond Silicon Valley have seen a step change in recent years in quality, scale and an abundance of experienced founder and operator talent, along with deeper pockets of capital. There has never been a better time for tech entrepreneurs in Europe.”',\n",

Indeed, along with the Series A, the company has announced a new deep technology called “Federate,” for which it has just filed several patents.\\n\\nCo-founder and Chief Product Officer Dr. Giovanni Tummarello explained the value of the technology: “Siren stands at the forefront of augmented analytics, the new wave of analytics in which AI techniques give analysts unprecedented powers of investigation. In Siren, techniques like knowledge graph/link analysis, entity resolution, search, natural language processing and predictive analytics seamlessly come together in a single UI. Siren is easy to deploy and leverages data directly on backends such as Elasticsearch, relational databases, virtual data warehouses and graph databases.”\\n\\nCEO John Randles said: “The demand for investigative intelligence and large-scale interconnected data analysis is constantly accelerating. Our platform uniquely enables this in real-time at a scale that companies and government organizations require. In this sector it is critical to not only raise funds, but also to have the right wealth of experience. For this reason, we’re delighted to have Bob Griffin join the board.”\\n\\nCurrently with DVI Equity Partners, Griffin is a veteran of intelligence and law enforcement software and former CEO of i2, which was acquired by IBM to become the world’s most deployed intelligence and law enforcement software.\\n\\nGriffin commented: “We believe Siren is a pioneer in a market that is about to explode. We are pleased to support their ongoing success and become part of a journey that will see investigative intelligence technologies shape the future direction of law enforcement, cyber security and financial fraud.” Gerry Maguire of Atlantic Bridge remarked on how the investment will propel the business forward: “The latest round of funding will enable Siren to further develop its proposition and expand into new markets, consolidating its position as an industry leader. Siren is revolutionizing the augmented analytics field, creating unprecedented value especially for organizations with large real-time data.”',\n",
       " 'Thing-it, the German proptech building a digitalisation platform for smart buildings, has raised\\xa0 €4.2 million in growth capital, co-led by PropTech1 Ventures and coparion. The startup wants to provide tools for efficient control and collaboration when it comes to property management in the IOT age.\\n\\nOffice buildings around the world already contain 1.3 billion connected devices, which is projected to 3.3 billion by 2022. These devices and modern sensors offer a ton of information and control over smart offices, co-working spaces, intelligent city quarters, and general facility management. Modern sensors can, for example, be used to cost-effectively determine room occupancy and optimize building use. Conditions of the room can be controlled remotely, such as shading, lighting, adaptive heating and cooling, even improved air circulation with savings of up to 30%. But to wield that control, there needs to be a central operating system.\\n\\nBased in Bad Homburg, Thing-it has developed a SaaS platform that serves as a “brain” for all the data and functions firing around an IOT-equipped office. Owners, tenants, employees, and facility managers can interact with each other, book rooms, and control access to certain areas. \\n\\nThanks to a growing network of hardware-, integration-, and operating partners, Thing-it’s platform can be individualized to a customer’s requirements. Projects so far include cube berlin and The Ship in Cologne.\\n\\nFounder and CEO Dr. Marc Gille-Sepehri said, “We have already shown in production what a wide range of functionality and value chains our digitalization platform can support in commercial real estate. The current financing round helps us to roll out this functionality to a broader market together with our partners.” \\n\\nNikolas Samios of PropTech1 Ventures commented, “Buildings are becoming more and more connected. This entails various potentials, but at the same time often enormous complexity, which classic real estate developers and, for example, at a later stage also facility managers can barely handle in their operations. Only through smart middleware such as Thing-it can digital real estate be mastered beyond glamorous showcase projects in the mass market.” ',\n",
       " 'Glue Collaboration, the Helsinki-based VR-driven collaboration platform, has raised a €3.5 million seed round led by Maki.vc. Other investors include Reaktor Innovations, Bragiel Brothers, and Foobar Technologies. Business Finland, the Finnish funding agency for technology and innovation, and OP Bank also participated. Glue is a cloud-based platform that facilitates virtual meetings between people around the world, bringing them together in a three-dimensional virtual space that’s completely customizable to the group. The experience is designed to serve as a powerful alternative to expensive physical face-to-face meetings and lackluster audio or video calling systems. The company, which began 15 years ago as an award-winning animation, XR and gaming studio and morphed into Glue in 2017, believes effective team collaboration requires not just communication but also the immersive feeling of “true presence” with other colleagues. In fact, Glue has just announced a new showcase of Microsoft security solutions in tandem with MacWell Creative, specifically an interactive, worldwide “escape room”-like VR experience called Intersection. Intersection brings together up to five participants in a shared virtual space to solve various cybersecurity puzzles and hacks in a race against the clock. Glue CEO Jussi Havu said: “We’re excited to partner with MacWell Creative on this concept, which serves as an excellent demonstration of what’s now possible from immersive 3D virtual spaces. When you enter Intersection, you interact with others as if you were face-to-face – there’s a true sense that you’re there with your teammates in the same physical space. That makes for high-quality collaboration as well as the much better rate of recall and retention that comes from learning by doing.” Commenting on the investment, Havu continued: “We are delighted that this group of leading technology investors believe in Glue and share our vision. We are now well positioned to accelerate the commercial phase of our growth and help organizations do business in a more productive and sustainable way.” Ilkka Kivimäki, partner at Maki.vc, said: “Providing the optimal setting for effective virtual collaboration is no easy undertaking, but we are excited about the progress Glue has made. The result is a platform that offers enormous potential for businesses serious about reducing travel and cutting their carbon footprint.”',\n",
       " 'Snowplow Analytics, a London-based startup that helps businesses collect and own their customer data, has closed a £4 million funding round from research-led VC firm MMC Ventures. Motivated from their own frustration when trying to use legacy analytics tools, Alexander Dean and Yali Sassoon founded Snowplow in 2012. The result is an open-source platform that enables companies to collect their own customer behavioural data across their entire digital estates. Dean, now CEO, explained: “Snowplow was founded with the aim of freeing data teams from the constraints imposed by traditional analytics vendors. Every industry now has its ‘Amazon’, ‘AirBnB’ or ‘Uber’: a determined tech or product-led disruptor that is using data to drive insights. In this new world, there’s an increased demand for organisations to become much more data-informed. Snowplow helps data teams build that strategic foundation for their customer data. Snowplow has over 150 customers across a broad range of sectors and geographies, including Strava, La Presse The Economist, Weebly, Hudl, Auto Trader, Omio and Secret Escapes. The funding will support the company’s continued expansion in the US and Europe and further product development. Commenting on the investment, Dean continued: “It’s fantastic to have the MMC Ventures team on board as our first VC investor. Ollie and the team showed huge engagement with our product and real enthusiasm for what we’re doing, so it felt an obvious, natural fit. We’re excited to see how their support will spur us on in this next phase of growth.” Oliver Richards, investment director at MMC Ventures, said: “Having experienced the limitations of traditional analytics solutions first-hand, Alex and the team have demonstrated a real understanding of their customers’ pain-points, which is obvious in their impressive roster of clients across a huge range of sectors. Needless to say, we’ve been very impressed with how Snowplow has grown its team and technology organically without funding to this point, and we’re delighted to be central to the next exciting stage of growth.”',\n",

This is where the EQT Ventures team can help and, with a large multi-stage fund, we can support and coach entrepreneurs on their journeys for longer so they can scale and deliver long-term, sustainable growth. Europe has never lacked ambition, talent or innovation but compared with the US, European start-ups have often struggled to access the capital they needed to grow from bright ideas into proven businesses. With this fund, EQT Ventures wants to continue to help close this funding gap and the fund’s size is clear evidence of the growing confidence in European tech, which is punching above its weight. The EQT Ventures team is looking forward to partnering with the boldest founders in Europe and the US, determined to build global winners.”\\n\\nEQT and its second fund both have global ties. In addition to its Stockholm headquarters, the firm has offices in London, San Francisco, Amsterdam, and Berlin. The new fund is backed by a global blue-chip investor base consisting of pension funds, insurance companies, financial institutions, foundations, family offices, and others, based in Europe, the US, and Asia.

       " 'Remedee Labs, the French medtech pioneering a new electronic treatment for pain, announced it has raised $12 million over the course of this year. The Series A round was led by Hardware Club, with participation from Habert-Dassault Finance, Partech, C4 Ventures, Supernova Invest, plus a group of private investors. The funding will support the next phase of clinical testing for the startup’s breakthrough endorphin-stimulation pain management solution.\\n\\nFollowing years of intensive research and development, the company has developed a new approach to pain relief: stimulating a person’s endorphins in the brain – recognized as the body’s highly effective natural pain killer – in a safe, fast, and simple way, and using electricity rather than pharmaceuticals.\\n\\nIn fact, the treatment could be self-administered by individual patients. The solution is based on the company’s patented Microelectronic Endorphin Trigger (MEET) module, the first millimeter-wave emitting module for medical usage. Thanks to the miniaturized MEET module, the technology can be implemented in small wearable devices, which makes personal healthcare possible.\\n\\nRemedee Labs was founded in 2016 in Grenoble, France by three experts in micro and nano medical technologies and biomedical research: Jacques Husser, David Crouzier, and Michael Foerster. Having spent the first years testing the treatment’s scientific viability, the team is ready to make its work public, especially as the global opioid crisis demands new approaches to pain management.\\n\\nCommenting on the breakthrough technology, president of Hardware Club Alexis Houssou said: “We’re at a groundbreaking moment where technology allows us to go beyond traditional drugs and medication, such as opioids. After seeing Remedee’s work at CEA-Leti, we were blown away by the quality of their team and the scale of their vision. Our investment in this company, and in the future of health as we know it, is truly exciting; the unprecedented early results set the tone for what’s coming next.” ',\n",

The platform they’ve built does this and more. \\n\\nLet’s Do This has information about 30,000 races around the world, of all types and distances, with hard-to-find details and exclusive booking perks for its members. These include free cancellation protection, which lets people pull out of a race if they’ve got an injury or simply cold feet.\\n\\nBeyond facilitating and fail-safing the registration process, Let’s Do This also wants to encourage people to live healthier, more active lives. In fact, the company’s recent $5 million seed round, led by NFX, got investments from professional athletes such as Usain Bolt, Serena Williams and Paula Radcliffe. \\n\\nSerena Williams commented on the latest funding: “I’ve seen first-hand the incredible impact these events can have on making people fitter, healthier and happier. I love that Let’s Do This is not only making events like these more accessible, but also helping to support athletes of all different fitness levels. Women are especially less likely to participate in marathons and obstacle races, so it’s really important there’s a platform encouraging people to step out of their comfort zones and make a positive difference in their lives.”\\n\\nWith the fresh funding, Let’s Do This will expand the team across its San Francisco and London offices.

We’re fanatical about ensuring anyone joining the team shares our intensity and long term commitment to our mission; Lyle and the whole EQT Ventures team have consistently shown us that they live by these same values.”\\n\\n“Perhaps not surprisingly given the space, the Let’s Do This team is one of the most hyper-competitive and driven teams I’ve met,” said Lyle. “They are tackling a rapidly growing $30bn market for endurance challenges, which has generally been low-tech and fragmented. Sam, Alex and the team attacks this problem with the same mentality and determination as they do when they were winning world-class events. I would hate to have to compete with them!”',\n",

The loan is guaranteed by the Juncker Plan, under which the EIB and the European Commission are working together to boost the competitiveness of the European economy. Bitmovin powers world-leading video streaming services offered directly to viewers over the internet, also known as “over-the-top” (OTT) media services. Its global pool of customers include the BBC, fuboTV, Hulu Japan, RTL and iFlix. Previous investors include pan-European VCs such as Atomico, which led the 2016 Series A, and Highland Europe, which led the $30 million Series B in 2018. The financing will allow the company to strengthen its research and development and product development team in Austria and also support investments in sales and marketing to scale up its distribution network. Bitmovin CEO Stefan Lederer said: “We feel very honoured to receive this EIB funding. Since founding Bitmovin it was our vision to shape the future of video and provide the best streaming experiences for our customers and viewers. Our founding team started by contributing research and development to modern video standards, and now we’re excited to accelerate that effort with this investment.” EIB Vice-President Andrew McDowell, who is responsible for operations in Austria at the Bank, said: “Bitmovin has developed an intelligent approach to delivering an optimised video experience and solving bandwidth issues, utilising a software-driven solution uncoupled from hardware. Young and innovative companies are key ingredients for ensuring sustainable growth and creating high-value jobs. They play an important part in driving long-term competitiveness. For the EIB, the EU bank, this is a top priority. Supporting investment that is geared towards innovation, skills and greater competitiveness is part of our mission to foster sustainable growth and jobs in Europe.

       " 'OfficeRnD, the all-in-one software for coworking and flexible workspaces, has raised $3 million in funding, led by Flashpoint Venture Capital and Launchub Ventures. Since its launch in 2017, the London-based startup has tripled its revenue year-over-year, used by over 100 businesses in over 1,000 locations worldwide. The new funding will help the company grow even faster.\\n\\nCoworking spaces are proliferating as remote work is embraced across sectors. Flexible workspaces are attractive to commercial real estate owners and entrepreneurs, but they can be a logistical hassle. Operating a coworking space involves serving hundreds of people and making sure they are billed correctly, can reserve shared resources, and have access to the right technologies and physical locations. There’s often a strong community component; operators need to make sure that members and tenants get along nicely with each other. OfficeRnD has built a software platform to solve many of these challenges. It automates key business processes and integrates other workspace technologies such as access control, wi-fi, and printing. To provide an end-to-end solution, OfficeRnD also offers a suite of white-label apps that help the members engage with their office (book rooms, self-administration) and the workspace community. Co-founder and CEO Miro Miroslavov explained the product’s value and the company’s mission: “With the new funding, we plan to speed up our growth and redefine the workspace as we know it. By automating all key business processes and significantly improving the members’ experience, OfficeRnD plays a key role in shaping the future of flexible working. We will use the investment to take the user experience, the functionality depth of our products and the services we provide to a new level and achieve our long-term vision: to make flexible working (Workspace as a Service) the way of working.” Alex Konoplyasty of Flashpoint Venture Capital commented, “We looked into the market and were very impressed with Miro and the OfficeRnD team, which managed to build a market leader in the US and UK markets, incubating their R&D team in Bulgaria. With our investment they will be able to scale their R&D and Sales team further to be able to service even more happy customers.” Todor Breshkov of LAUNCHub Ventures said, “We are among the first investors in OfficeRnD and we made a bet in this company when the term ‘future of work’ was not even a buzzword. Miroslav has proven to be an amazing founder, who managed to build a strong team and the best product in the space, loved by their clients. The transformation in this industry is happening now and we are happy to continue being part of OfficeRnD’s journey.”',\n",
       " 'Berlin-based\\xa0BRYTER, the no-code automation platform that enables business experts to build apps, has raised a $6 million late-seed funding round led by Accel, with participation from Notion Capital and existing investors such as Cavalry Ventures and several angels. Certain professional fields, such as law, banking, insurance, and tax compliance, struggle to keep up with digital transformation and adopt all the automation that technology has made available. BRYTER wants to give these professionals the tools to build powerful, dynamic apps without any programming. No IT skills are necessary to design, deploy, and analyze custom apps, apps that can function for complex industries at an enterprise scale. As a result, BRYTER’s SaaS platform gives these fields the time savings of automated technology, plus the cost savings of not developing software in-house or through a third-party. CEO and co-founder Michael Grupp explained: “Many of the most valuable business professionals and domain experts can’t digitize, scale or let alone automate their knowledge. Existing tools are either targeted at skilled IT experts or do not have the necessary complexity for the legal, financial and compliance industries. BRYTER was developed specifically for these industries. It unlocks the knowledge contained in MS Word and PDFs, and our rapid growth and adoption by the leading industry players speaks to the urgent need for our product in the market.” Since its launch in 2018, the German startup has opened offices in Frankfurt and London and secured some big-name customers, such as PwC Legal in Europe and Accenture in the US. The new funding, which brings the company’s total to $9 million, will go toward continued research and development, as well as the creation of a global customer success strategy to ensure customers (which have vast enterprise operations) can adopt BRYTER as quickly as possible. Commenting on the investment, Luca Bocchio of Accel said, “The BRYTER team caught our attention early on with the quality of their platform, their unique approach, and the significant market demand for their product. Having backed some of the leading global players in automation and SaaS, we immediately recognized BRYTER’s potential and are thrilled to partner with them to accelerate their early success and scale globally.” Bocchio and Jos White of Notion will join the startup’s board.',\n",
       " 'CoachHub, the Berlin-based digital coaching platform, has announced a €10 million round from existing investors HV Holtzbrinck Ventures, Partech, and Speedinvest, plus new investor RTP Global. The news comes just three months after its inaugural €6 million fundraise. Dubbing itself a “mobile coaching cloud,” the startup democratises professional coaching, taking services usually reserved for top executives and making them available to employees at any level in the company. CoachHub’s AI-based matching system recommends three business coaches that fit the employee’s individual requirements and personal requests. The platform boasts a global network of more than 400 certified coaches across six continents and over 30 languages. Coaches work remotely with employees at over 100 organisations, including large corporations like Generali and Bosch Rexroth, and household tech companies like SoundCloud and HelloFresh. Serial entrepreneurs and brothers Yannis and Matti Niebelschuetz founded the company in 2018, and have since built a team that’s currently 75 employees and forecasted to grow to 200 by mid-2020. Yannis Niebelschuetz explained the company’s success: “Our customers are seeing measurable results in terms of increased rates of employee retention and happiness. Regular, tailored coaching sessions have been shown to have a positive impact on business and employee performance. However, the reliance of traditional formats on in-person coaching sessions, which is inflexible, time-consuming and unscalable, has kept coaching out of reach for all but the most senior staff. We are fundamentally disrupting the learning and development landscape and democratising access to business coaching.” The funding will help the startup grow its pool of coaches in the UK, as well as its core markets in France, Germany, Benelux and the Nordics. In addition to the platform and business operation side of things, the funds will further develop the company’s Coaching Lab, a think tank for behavioural research in the coaching space, designed to support coach development. Commenting on the investment, David Kuczek of HV Holtzbrinck Ventures said: “Digital coaching has become a billion dollar market that’s increasing year on year, and we see CoachHub as the clear category leader in Europe. We’re really impressed by the team’s execution in building this platform and the rapid customer traction it’s gained since launching last year.”',\n",

The firm reports its first-ever fund was oversubscribed by 64 percent, exclusively from commercial LPs who are interested in sector-specific investments. Angular was founded in May 2018 and, during its period of “stealth mode,” has built a portfolio of 12 companies from Israel, the UK, Finland, Romania, and other countries. Its founder and managing partner, Gil Dibner, wanted to create a firm that focuses on a single sector, rather than any geographic boundaries, and grows startups through rapid US expansion. The firm invests early, anywhere from day one to Series A, with cheques ranging from $250,000 to $1.5 million. Dibner commented: “Our LPs have given Angular the green light to invest anywhere in Europe and Israel. This broad geographic mandate coupled with our specific industry focus and long track record in enterprise tech investing provides Angular Ventures with a distinct sourcing advantage: for example, we recently backed Valohai, a Finnish company building a version control platform for AI/ML. As part of our due diligence process, our network of domain experts also assessed eight competing companies spread across Israel, UK, Poland, and the Nordics – something no other VC was able to do. We selected Valohai’s Finnish team for their team, product offering, revenue, and clear roadmap towards global category leadership.” Of the $41 million in the new fund, over 50 percent comes from the US, and 74 percent of the capital base is institutional, including two US-based endowments, several leading fund-of-funds, and sophisticated family offices from around the world.',\n",

Investors include Temasek, an investment company from Singapore, and the Scottish Investment Bank.\\xa0 What is LiFi? It’s a technology, invented by pureLiFi itself, that uses light to power wireless communications, rather than radio frequencies, which are used for Wi-Fi and cellular networks. The company claims its LiFi alternative is fast, highly secure, and more reliable than the traditional systems. The market for LiFi technology is estimated to reach $75 billion in the next five years. In the meantime, the technology is being globally standardised under 802.11 (a set of wireless LAN standards and protocols), expected to be fully ratified by 2021.\\n\\nThe Scottish startup is leading the way. Early this year, it announced a change of focus from developing systems to manufacturing actual LiFi components that can be installed in devices. At Mobile World Congress in February, the company demonstrated how its new Gigabit LiFi integrates into a laptop; tablets and cell phones are possible as well. Since then, new collaborations with manufacturers (Getac), telecommunications companies (O2 Telefonica), and lighting companies (Zumtobel and Wipro) have kept the momentum going. “Device manufacturers are looking for new ways to provide devices with faster, more reliable and secure connectivity. LiFi is the natural next step in the evolution of global wireless communications and pureLiFi is leading the way to provide this technology to the market,” explains pureLiFi CEO Alistair Banham. “Our investors believe in our team and our strategy to provide LiFi for every light and every device, and we have the products to support mobile device integration of LiFi.” \\n\\nCo-found and CSO Professor Harald Haas is over the moon about the traction of LiFi technology, which he helped invent, and the new funding that will fuel its market takeover: “After more than a decade of persistent and systematic development of key technologies for wireless communications using light and the demonstration of the almost unlimited capabilities of LiFi for secure gigabit wireless connectivity for many use cases such as machine-to-machine communication, we are now at the precipice of a watershed moment for LiFi.

Europe has about 30,000 manufacturers that tailor-make products based on customer requirements, and each purchase must go through a procurement process. That’s a lot of room for miscommunication, misalignment, and confusion. \\n\\nProcurementFlow aims to digitise this process with its cloud-based software for procurement teams. The SaaS also works with customers in the civil engineering, energy, and food and beverages sector, where the processes and pain points are similar.

The deal has OLX investing $400 million, comprised of a primary injection of capital in FCG and the contribution of OLX’s joint-venture shares in India and Poland, plus buying shares held by other investors, founders and management, subject to a tender offer process. Regardless of the uptake by investors in the tender process, the transaction will result in OLX Group becoming the largest shareholder in FCG.\\n\\nFCG, founded in 2016 and led by 26-year-old Sujay Tyle, is one of the top five best-funded automotive tech businesses in the world, closing a hefty Series B last year. The company provides a used car marketplace for emerging economies. On FCG’s platform, both sellers and dealers have an easier time navigating the market and the transaction itself. Sellers are offered a suite of new services such as “guaranteed buy,” inspection, financing and many post-sale offerings, such as warranties and insurance. Dealers have access to a wider range of inventory, proprietary inspection reports, floor-plan financing, pricing guides and other services.\\n\\nOLX offers sellers and dealers a well-known, respected, and global listing service to buy and sell used cars, but the service stops with classified ads. Therefore the corporation will integrate FCG’s technology and marketplace to dramatically increase the services available to users and expand faster.\\n\\nTyle, the co-founder and CEO of Frontier Car Group, said: “FCG has nearly tripled performance across every key metric since the first OLX Group investment less than 18 months ago and has expanded to four new countries in that time. This is a testament to FCG’s team, the ripe market opportunity, and the results of early integration with OLX in our key markets.

The round was led by Hiro Capital, a new gaming and entertainment VC fund that launched last month, with support from Sky Ventures, which also invested in Hiro’s fund. Jack Attridge and Pavle Mihajlovic founded the studio back in 2015 with the idea of bringing together the immersive narrative of films with the interactive experience of games. Through storytelling, soundtracks, and new technology, Flavourworks is producing games unlike any other on the market.\\n\\nThe studio’s first release, Erica, is a live-action interactive thriller in which a player’s decisions impact the story of the female protagonist. Beyond simple choices or navigating to an end goal, Flavourworks’ Touch Video technology allows the player to occupy the virtual world in a more nuanced, human way. Using the touchpad on Sony’s Dualshock 4 or a mobile device screen, the player can “touch” the world — can wipe a tear off a character’s face, or peer through a door slowly so as not to be discovered. Mihajlovic explains: “Erica merges the worlds of film and video games in a way that no one’s done before.

       " 'Chaser, the London-based provider of credit control cloud software, has announced a $4 million funding round led by Fuel Ventures, with participation from Sussex Place Ventures, Beacon Capital, and Craig Winkler.\\n\\nDavid Tuck founded the cloud accounting startup in 2014 to help small businesses cope with financial challenges, such as late payments, which restrict cash flow and curtail growth. Indeed, the company’s name comes from the occasional and unfortunate need to chase down clients to pay invoices. Chaser’s software automates this process and provides insight to business owners about how to best manage the credit granted to customers.\\n\\nExplaining the market need for his product, Tuck said: “SMEs in the UK are currently owed over £225 billion in unpaid invoices. For many, selling on payment terms is a broken experience. This is due to late payments, which straitjacket growth. Since our launch five years ago, we have freed businesses from the burden of late payments. We’re extremely proud of what we have accomplished since 2014 and, with the introduction of our new Virtual Credit Control Service Incubator, we can help accountants and bookkeepers to level the playing field for SMEs”.\\xa0 The incubator he mentions is also called the ChaseAcademy, a 12-week programme that teaches accountants and bookkeepers how to provide professional credit control to their SME clients, via the Chaser software. For those small and medium-sized businesses who don’t have an in-house finance team, the option to fully outsource credit control to a trusted partner could be a relief.\\n\\nCommenting on the funding, Mark Pearson of Fuel Ventures said: “We’re excited to have joined Chaser on their journey as they continue to deliver effective and ground-breaking Cloud Credit Control. They have already established themselves as a market leader and with the introduction of ChaseAcademy, will only continue to innovate the Cloud Accounting landscape. They have a very exciting future ahead of them and we are thrilled to be a part of it.”\\n\\nThe investment will help expand the product development team, which will roll out a variety of new features in 2020.

       " 'VOI, the Swedish e-scooter operator, has announced $85 million in Series B funding. The round, led by Vostok New Ventures, was joined by many other investment firms: Balderton Capital, Creandum, Project A, BME Ventures, Raine Ventures, Kreos Capital, Inbox Capital, Rider Global, Black Ice Capital, and others. The Stockholm-based micro-mobility startup has raised $135 million since its launch in September 2018, growing to 38 cities across 10 countries in its first year. With over 4 million users, the business is already profitable in some of those cities. CEO and co-founder Fredrik Hjelm commented on the success thus far: “There’s been a huge demand for VOI’s e-scooters from residents across Europe in the last 12 months but making a landmark change to transport in Europe takes more than simply flooding cities with thousands of scooters. We are developing a long-term business that gives people a new way of moving around cities that’s clean, fast, convenient and also fun. We have seen the strongest unit economics of all of our peers and will continue to optimize and invest in that.” Actually the company attributes its success not only to good unit economics or proprietary technology (both of which it has), but also to its cooperation with cities and governments from the get-go, which creates a “collaborative approach to regulation, safety, and sustainability.” VOI says it adapts its e-mobility product to local needs. Both the in-house technology platform and the next generation of VOI vehicles will get an infusion of funding from this Series B. Otherwise the company’s plan is to further expand and monetise the service. Commenting on the investment, CEO of Vostock New Ventures Per Brilioth said: “VOI is only at the start of developing micro-mobility based on Swedish values right across Europe. In Germany, in particular, there is a huge market to go for. We are excited that this additional funding will enable the company to introduce a new generation of e-scooters that are clean, good-looking and safe, enabling people to get around the cities they love quickly and easily.”',\n",

       " 'Immersive Labs, the UK provider of a cyber skills training platform, has raised $40 million from Summit Partners and existing investor Goldman Sachs to accelerate expansion in North America.\\n\\nImmersive Labs has built a fully interactive, on-demand cyber skills platform that allows professionals to develop new skills at their own pace and on their own schedules. The program features story-driven and gamified simulations, designed to enable both security specialists and business users to step into real-world cybersecurity situations based on real-world attack techniques. Through these exercises, users learn how to guard against security threats, from identifying phishing attacks to reverse-engineering malware.\\n\\nThe platform also maps users’ skills throughout an organisation, providing internal data analysis that identifies specific skill shortages and vulnerabilities that a company should address. Immersive Labs CEO James Hadley is actually a former UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) cybersecurity instructor. He explained the need for a new medium and method of education: “Gaps in cybersecurity knowledge meaningfully increase risk to an organization, creating vulnerability and presenting opportunity for attackers. The rapid, constantly evolving threat landscape has made traditional classroom training for cyber skills obsolete. At a time when cyber skills are stretched across the board, the Immersive Labs platform enables companies to identify these weak points and rapidly skill people to address them.” The Bristol-based company has grown rapidly since its launch in 2017, with 750 percent year-over-year increase in annual recurring revenues and a team headcount over 100. Its new North American headquarters in Boston will lead further expansion in that continent, where the company finds demand is high.\\n \\nCommenting on the investment, Antony Clavel of Summit Partners said, “We recognize in Immersive Labs many of the same qualities that we’ve seen in other cybersecurity leaders: a technically strong and strategically thoughtful management team; a differentiated product addressing a large and urgent market need; and a rapidly growing base of blue-chip customers. We believe Immersive Labs is well-positioned to become a global category leader in cyber skills development.”\\xa0 ',\n",

As business model investors, we focus on real customer value and sustainable cash flows.

In fact, the startup has a customer satisfaction rate or 99.4 percent, suggesting it is indeed realizing its mission.\\n\\n“FirstVet is the first truly neutral stakeholder in the world to coordinate pet care. In what is a highly privatised industry, our reliable service provides value to the entire sector, and we are growing at an incredible rate,” says CEO and co-founder David Prien.\\n\\nHenry Gladwyn, principal at OMERS Ventures, echoed Prien’s statement: “It’s rare for a startup to provide genuine value to the entire ecosystem in which it operates, with FirstVet quickly becoming an irreplaceable service for pet owners, and a trusted partner for vets, clinics, and insurance companies.

Earth Science AI is the only platform capable of predicting hours, weeks or decades in advance how the climate will impact cities and countries, businesses and governments.\\n\\nThe platform combines research and modelling techniques from Earth sciences – including atmospheric science, meteorology, hydrology and agronomy – with artificial intelligence, imaging, machine learning and Bayesian statistics. The result is that it can predict climate impact, from gradual (soil changes) to sudden (natural disasters), which allows users to gauge political and economic consequences and manage risk. Such “climate simulations” can be generated for individual plots of land or entire countries, with a variety of applications, including in insurance, food, infrastructure, investment, and climate and security policy. Iggy Bassi, founder and CEO, explained: “Our world-class team has designed an Earth Science AI platform to quantify both short- and long-range risks to ensure mission-critical decisions are informed in real time. The potential is huge to radically alter the ability to quantify and personalise interconnected risks for users across any space and time at low cost and at mass scale.” Indeed, the platform’s unique selling point is its ability to transform decision making. A customer can run vast numbers of simulations on specific regions to show all the possible outcomes. The company provided this question as an example query: “Where should we source maize from in 2022 if the temperature in a region rises by 2-degrees?”\\n\\nThe team behind the platform hails from over 30 universities, including Imperial College, the Alan Turing Institute, Cambridge, UCL, Harvard and Oxford.\\n\\nCervest aims to release a beta version in the first quarter of 2020, designed specifically for risk practitioners in the financial, insurance, government and CPG sectors. Focusing on European markets for now, the company is on track to have all of Europe mapped before the beta launch; it will map the rest of the world after that.\\n\\nCommenting on the investment, Bassi said, “We are delighted Future Positive Capital and Astanor Ventures have joined our journey.\\xa0 Our goal is to empower everyone to make informed decisions that improve the long-term resilience of our planet. Today decision-makers are struggling with climate uncertainty and extreme events and how they are affecting their business operations, assets, investments, or policy choices.”\\n\\nSofia Hmich, founder of Future Positive Capital said: “Our mission is to back companies that use deep tech – and the sharpest and most ambitious minds – to solve the world’s most pressing problems. Making crucial decisions in the face of climate uncertainty is one of them and Cervest is doing just that. With reports suggesting we have fewer than 60 years of farming left unless drastic action is taken, the need for science-backed decisions could not be greater. Businesses and policy makers hold the key to change and with access to Cervest’s proprietary AI technology they can start to make that change a reality at low cost – before it’s too late.” ',\n",

       " 'Forecast, the Copenhagen-based startup applying AI to project management, has raised a $5.5 million funding round led by Crane Venture Partners, along with existing investors SEED Capital and Heartcore.\\n\\nBy automating manual tasks, adding predictive capabilities, and providing more visibility among teams, Forecast’s project management software has saved customers time and improved collaboration and workflow. In fact, customers report administrative tasks go down by 20-40% while insight into project risk and resource management go up.\\n\\nLike many great tech solutions, the SaaS software was born of the creator’s frustration in his own experience. Founder and CEO Dennis Kayser worked as a consultant for many years and grew tired of all the administrative tedium involved in reporting hours, updating deadlines, and other necessary tasks.\\n\\nHe commented on Forecast’s potential impact with this new investment: “We’ve already seen project management enter the digital age, moving from notepads and whiteboards to spreadsheets and task management lists. With Forecast, project management is poised for its next evolution with automation and insights, freeing project managers to instead focus on strategic activities like planning, resource and relationship management.”\\n\\nThanks to some choice integrations, the software fits seamlessly into users’ existing workflows and has so far helped manage more than 40,000 projects around the world. Since the company’s start in 2016, the customer base has grown steadily without any outbound marketing; annual revenue growth has even seen a triple digit increase.\\n\\nNo doubt those numbers were a draw for the new investors. Krishna Visvanathan of Crane Venture Partners said, “We have been extremely impressed with the Forecast team and are excited to back the company for its next stage of growth. With deep insights into its customers’ needs and new data on how to improve project management, we see great potential for Forecast to help millions of businesses improve their operations, client relations and more around the world.”\\n\\nWith the funding, the Danish startup will hire across engineering, product, sales, customer success and marketing, growing its 38-person team and opening a new sales office in London early next year.',\n",

Users can buy and trade directly on the app, which is free for basic orders.

       " 'Inne, the Berlin-based femtech, has raised an €8 million in Series A round, led by Blossom Capital with support Monkfish Equity, an early backer of the startup, as well as angel investors such as Taavet Hinrikus, co-founder of TransferWise; Tom Stafford, managing partner at DST; and Trivago co-founder Rolf Schromgens. The startup’s mission is to help women make informed choices about their fertility, through a combination of technology and natural hormone tracking. Founder and CEO Eirini Rapti started Inne in 2018 after working in healthcare for years and realizing, on a personal level, that natural fertility and contraception methods were hardly reliable in modern life. “It’s hard to go a day without reading headlines about young women and their fertility. Women want to know more about their bodies and how to control their reproductive health. They may have concerns about when is the right time to start a family or they may already have decided that they don’t want to take hormones because of the side effects they experience. Many women feel that the current options do not meet their needs,” she explained. Eirini wanted to develop technology that could assist women in understanding their bodies and contraceptive choices, and she knew the product had to satisfy the following requirements: compatible with a busy daily life, simple and hygienic to use, and more insightful than period-tracking apps already on the market. The result is a saliva biosensor device that enables women to identify and predict the fertile phase in their natural cycle, and it has already achieved medical certification in Europe. Developed by a cross-functional team of scientists, designers and engineers who developed the biosensor and reader as well as the connected app, the Inne product will be available later this year. Louise Samet, partner at Blossom Capital, said: “Inne has a winning combination of scientific validity plus usability that can enable women to better understand their bodies at all stages in their lives. What really impressed us is the team’s meticulous focus on design and easy-of-use together with the scientific validity and clear ambition to impact women all over the world. We are very excited to join Eirini and her extraordinary team on the next stage of their journey.” The Series A will allow Inne to recruit across Europe and expand its team, specifically through engineering, design, and operations.',\n",

       " 'Artmyn, the Swiss startup that develops scanning technology for artwork, has raised 4 million CHF (about €3.6 million) in convertible notes, co-led by its year-long partner Invaluable, an online marketplace for fine arts, and existing private investors.\\n\\nArtmyn set out in 2014 to revolutionize how artwork is experienced on screen, enhancing perception and understanding of the piece beneath its visible surface and beyond a typical 2D image. The company’s scanners produce an interactive ultra-high resolution view of the artwork with over 1.5 billion pixels, and an immersive video, browsable with different light orientations, under visible light and ultraviolet. Along with the new funding, the company has announced a brand new infrared scanning technology, which captures underlayers, sketches and markings underneath the “finished product.” \\n\\n“Until today in the art world, infrared analysis was reserved to rare works, and upon request only – Artmyn not only automizes this procedure during the scanning process, but also makes it completely safe, and at no additional cost. As a result, we expect a lot of unforeseen discoveries, from secret touch ups and preliminary drawings to hidden signatures or dates, to an entire painting hidden underneath the surface of a canvas. This of course, is a major step forward for when it comes to expertisation, authentication and the overall available information about an artwork,” said co-founder and CEO Alexandre Catsicas.\\n\\nSuch non-invasive scanning technology ensures the authenticity and condition of a piece of art, as it moves through the global art market: shipment, storage, restoration, and other events. In terms of security and transparency, the scanner generates a digital fingerprint that makes the original artwork impossible to forge. The digital file facilitates research and identification in case of theft, disappearance, or damage. As for its effect on the art market, the technology is designed to “fluidify” the art market and boost online sales. Invaluable CEO Rob Weisberg explained: “This technology will give our auction house partners a new, powerful and unique tool to win consignments, drive sell-through, and vastly improve the digital art buying experience. It adds value at all stages of an auction house sale-cycle. This investment also directly addresses two critical areas in the online art market: transparency and buyer confidence.”\\n\\nWeisberg, who will join Artmyn’s board, continued: “We’re excited to invest in Artmyn because the combination of its incredible technology with Invaluable’s marketplace of the world’s top auction houses will revolutionize the art market. It will allow auction houses to treat every artwork like a masterpiece.” \\n\\nThe funding will power further scanning technology developments, as well as the manufacture and distribution of scanners to more auction houses in Europe and the US via strategic partnerships with Geneva Free-Ports and Invaluable Arts.',\n",

Prophesee has developed proprietary sensors and algorithms in neuromorphic vision, which mimic how the human eye and brain work and can be applied in autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, security surveillance, etc. After three generations of development, the company recently launched its first off-the-shelf and production-ready event-based sensor, Metavision. In Prophesee-patented Metavision sensors, each pixel is independent and asynchronous, only activating itself if it senses a change in the scene, a movement — called an “event.” This event-based approach to machine vision has a suite of benefits: lower requirements of power, latency, and data processing requirements compared to traditional frame-based systems; higher dynamic ranges of vision; and it’s more cost-efficient to boot. With $68 million in funding to date, the company will now accelerate the commercialization of its technology. The next-generation version will target automotive and consumer markets, including autonomous driving and advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS), as well as uses in virtual/augmented reality and the Internet of Things. “Our event-based approach to vision sensing and processing has resonated well with our customers in the automotive, industrial and IoT sectors, and the technology continues to achieve impressive results in benchmarking and initial industrialization engagements.

Pollen offers insider access, giveaways, and rewards to various activities (or what it calls “experiences”) in music, sports, and travel — from beach holidays and festivals to a broad range of ski packages. Users, largely young consumers, can invite their friends, creating a distribution channel much like online word-of-mouth. The platform enables Pollen and associated brands to cash in on the $800 billion that 16–28-year-olds spend annually. “In today’s world, young people want to maximise what they want to do with their life because they’re more aware of the opportunities out there and their own potential.” Says Callum, CEO and co-founder. “Our model will allow members and their friends to discover and access experiences that are usually out of reach and at the same time create an incredibly powerful distribution channel for brands.” The platform has sold almost 800,000 experiences in total; it works with over 500 global brands including Live Nation, MGM Resorts, TAO, Hakkasan, AEG and C3; and has secured partnerships with Ticketmaster, Eventbrite, Priceline, Stubhub, and SeeTickets. To continue expanding, the company has made some acquisitions across North America, such as Lifestylez, the largest college ski and snowboard “experience” provider. “We want Pollen to be the best channel to buy products and experiences,” says Liam, CRO and co-founder, also Callum’s brother. “That’s why we’ve always given rewards that are tied to the experience rather than cash, to ensure it’s an authentic recommendation. We’re focused on what would the world feel like if millions of people used Pollen – it has to be driven by passion.” Commenting on the opportunity ahead, Gareth Jefferies, investment manager at Northzone, said: “The most exciting prospect for me is the potential the company has to play a pivotal role in how brands engage with an entire demographic. In a few years’ time, if the company continues to execute, Pollen can become one of the most culturally significant companies for Gen Z, and be the best way of buying not just festival tickets and holidays, but to access all sorts of products and services.” The latest funding will go toward global expansion into new markets and new verticals.

       " 'Augmenta, an Athens-based agritech startup, has raised $2.5 million seed funding to improve the life of farmers through automated precision software that retrofits to existing farming equipment. The round was led by Hardware Club, the first global VC focused on hardware and full-stack startups, with support from Marathon Venture Capital. Agriculture is one of the last frontiers for digitisation. It therefore holds plenty of opportunity for optimisation, and current global circumstances demand that it innovates now: rapid population growth and climate change put a strain on traditional farming practices. The focus of the last century has been on large-scale farming, throwing chemicals at wide swaths of land to increase yields. New-age agriculture initiatives argue the next century’s focus should be on precision farming, as each square metre may need something different. With the right technology, such precision farming is actually easier and cheaper. Augmenta co-founders George Varvarelis and Dimitris Evangelopolous believe they have just the thing. “While the idea behind precision agriculture has always been a good one, the technology to make it immediately actionable just hasn’t been there. For the first time, we can deliver full, real-time automation and all the benefits that implies. We call it Augmented Agriculture and it is already making a difference,” said Dimitri Evangelopoulos, co-founder and COO of Augmenta. He and co-founder George Varvarelis have introduced a solution that automates feritilisation seamlessly, laying an AI-driven camera system on top of existing farming equipment. Six to twelve multispectral cameras are installed to fit the farmer’s machinery. Using instant imaging and AI, the “Field Analyzer” system determines how much fertiliser each inch of land needs, and then actually applies it by controlling the machinery release/pace. The result is higher quality crop, higher quantity crop, and lower amounts of fertiliser and the costs associated. An equally large selling point is that, after installing the system, farmers don’t need to change their practices at all. “The Augmenta team is ecstatic to see their hard work manifested in actual, boots-on-the-ground results, making the lives of farmers around the world easier and more profitable. Most of our original team members have a farming background which makes us laser-focused on delivering practical solutions that can be seamlessly incorporated into a farmer’s day-to-day operations,” said Varvarelis. After testing in eight countries, the offering is commercially available, with more solutions are on the way. Augmenta’s team is currently working on other crop treatments, such as pesticide and fungicide spraying, as well as specialized operations for vineyards and industrial tomato farms. New developments will be delivered via over-the-air software updates, so farmers don’t need to buy extra hardware. In addition to further research, the new funding will go toward the company’s expansion in North and South America.',\n",

       " 'Coadjute, a UK proptech startup, is partnering with housing associations L&Q, Notting Hill Genesis, Bromford and Origin to build a blockchain platform that will increase safety, efficiency and accountability in housing construction. The London-based cloud software company has already developed a decentralised workflow platform for businesses and customers involved in any element of real estate (“build, buy, occupy”). Now Coadjute wants to apply its proptech expertise for the greater good. After the 2017 Grenfell Tower tragedy that killed at least 70 people, the UK government commissioned an independent review of building regulations and fire safety, particularly in residential construction. Dame Judith Hackitt released her final report, now dubbed “the Hackitt Report,” with this main conclusion: “the current system of building regulations and fire safety is not fit for purpose and that a culture change is required to support the delivery of buildings that are safe, both now and in the future.” Coadjute has taken up this call and, along with several housing associations, is designing software to streamline and synchronize housing construction so that is more transparent, more efficient, and most importantly: safer. The software is called Quality Chain, a workflow application that unifies all stakeholders on a single project track – and seals cracks so no decisions or details can slip away as the project progresses through and among architects, developers, clients, subcontractors, and housing associations. Currently each of these parties operate their own distinct systems, each in a silo. Because Quality Chain is decentralised and built on blockchain, now all parties can share a single source of truth yet still retain their own technology, data, and security. John Reynolds, CEO and founder of Coadjute, said: “The UK needs to double the number of new homes built each year. The reality is that this cannot be achieved without a thorough overhaul of the technology underpinning construction. We believe blockchain provides the opportunity to unify, simplify and validate every stage in an otherwise complex process and create a trusted, immutable record, which all parties contribute to and agree.” Matthew Gardiner, head of ideation at L&Q said: “Quality Chain provides a method for all organisations involved in development to come to an agreement on any obligation, statement of work, deliverable or document providing a ‘single source of the truth’ as a basis for improving workflow management and efficiency. Its potential to improve quality and cut costs is significant.” The Quality Chain prototype has been completed, with the aim of bringing the product to market by March 2020. Coadjute was founded in 2018 and has raised £750,000 in seed funding to date.',\n",

Founded in Switzerland, Coople wants to disrupt the $470-billion traditional recruitment industry. The company’s platform uses an algorithm that matches its flexible workforce with the needs of companies. For instance, the algorithm takes into consideration a worker’s location, availability, experience (and ratings) and matches the criteria with requirements listed by the hiring organisation. Beyond the staff matching function, the platform provides end-to-end automation of the HR process; from planning, recruiting, on-boarding and hiring to workforce management, payroll and payments. Commenting on the growing impact of the service,\\xa0 CEO Rinaldo Olivari said: “We look forward to continuing on our path of revolutionising the world of work. On the one hand, Coople offers employees a convenient way to find high-quality, flexible jobs. On the other hand, Coople provides companies with reliable, easy access to our fast-growing pool of on-demand talent. Over the past year, we have seen that an increasing number of users are coming to our platform for more than just last-minute jobs. They now rely on Coople for a large part of their income or their core business.” The company has raised $76 million to date, and the platform currently has 400,000 registered job seekers and over 20,000 registered companies, primarily in the Swiss and British markets. The Series C will aid automation of the online platform and expansion within existing markets, as well as finance the company’s launch in the Netherlands and one other unnamed international region. David Klein, managing partner and co-founder of One Peak Partners, said “We look forward to our continuing collaboration with Coople, particularly with regard to further international expansion. The market for flexible talent remains one of the most exciting technology market opportunities in Europe, and, with its expanded management team, Coople is in prime position to further expand its market leadership.”',\n",

Founded in Tel Aviv back in 2015, Fabric provides “last-mile logistics” to help retailers of all sizes adopt on-demand fulfillment. The key is placing the logistic automation close to the end-consumer, so orders are completed locally in a network of micro-fulfillment centers. “Our production-proven micro-fulfillment platform is fundamentally changing the face of retail,” said Elram Goren, Fabric CEO and co-founder. “Driven by our world-class proprietary technology, we are designing and building an entirely new logistics infrastructure in cities so that on-demand fulfillment and delivery can happen faster, cheaper, and at scale. Whether it’s enabling retailers to profitably fulfill one-hour deliveries or helping businesses restock their storefronts more efficiently, we aim to be the solution that empowers businesses to better serve their customers.” In October 2018, Fabric launched the world’s smallest automated fulfillment center, which processes up to 600 orders a day with the ability to deliver in just one hour. Recently Fabric announced the buildout of an automated grocery site with three temperature zones, the first of a 12-site deal in partnership with one of Israel’s largest grocery chains. “The demand from the market for a location-first approach to automation is just staggering. Now, with this latest round of funding, Fabric is poised to enter a new stage of hypergrowth,” said Fabric CCO Steve Hornyak. The Israeli startup has raised $135 million to date, the last round a $20 million Series A in February 2018. This Series B will fuel expansion through US, where the company is currently building a network of its micro-fulfillment centers. The investment will also go towards growing the sales, operations, and technical support teams in the US, as well as the engineering teams in Tel Aviv. John Cadeddu, managing partner at Corner Ventures, commented: “Fabric is the micro-fulfillment market leader with a production-proven platform that drives tremendous value for its retail partners and consumers alike,” said “We are delighted to be partnering with the Fabric team in their incredible vision to reinvent how goods are fulfilled and delivered in this on-demand world, ultimately empowering retailers to provide faster deliveries at lower costs and at scale.”',\n",

Launched in Cambridge in 2017, the company wants to expand its secure operating system platform across the Internet of Things (IoT). Foundries.io cites a couple statistics to prove the demand of its service. The first is to do with security concerns across its intended market: 84 percent of organisations that have adopted IoT have experienced a security breach of their connected devices. The second is to do with the prohibitive associated costs: 44 percent of organisations report maintenance costs as a barrier to adoption of IoT. The British startup’s platform enables IoT devices to remain secure whilst providing lifetime software maintenance, at a fraction of current costs. The funding will fuel the rollout of FoundriesFactory, a self-service subscription solution providing turn-key services to develop, secure, deploy and maintain embedded, IoT or Edge products. It provides secure boot firmware and customizable operating system software updates, as well as build-and-test infrastructure with the latest software and security updates included. The ultimate benefit is lower maintenance and support costs, from early development to rollout.

The investment marks how seriously car manufacturers, brands, and insurers view cyber threats on connected vehicles. “This first of its kind investor syndicate, which includes some of the most important smart mobility companies in the world, is a testament to the severity of the problem the industry is tackling and a ringing endorsement of Upstream’s technology and the progress our team has made,” said Yoav Levy, Upstream Security co-founder and CEO. A security framework for connected cars entails a multi-layer approach that secures both the vehicles as well as the infrastructure connecting them: drivers, telematics, mobile applications, vehicles, fleets. Upstream’s entirely cloud-based C4 platform enables car manufacturers and fleets to detect, monitor, and respond to attacks on any part of the connected vehicle framework – even for vehicles already on the road. “Our mission is to protect every connected vehicle and smart mobility service on the planet – the completion of our funding is perfectly timed to meet the growing demand for our data driven cloud-based platform, providing our customers with the capabilities they need to accomplish this vitally important task,” Levy continued. Indeed, the demand for the security platform is growing along with the connected car market itself, which is estimated to pass $200 billion by 2025. To date, the Tel-aviv startup has raised $41 million to keep up. “Securing our customers’ connected vehicles is always top of mind for Volvo,” noted David Hanngren, Investment Director at Volvo Group. “We have chosen to invest in Upstream because they have a great vision for addressing this unique sector, an impressive management team and serious depth in both automotive domain expertise and cybersecurity.”',\n",

Speedy prediction is key, since identifying the best drug candidates for a given target requires sifting through millions of compounds.\\n\\n“Aqemia’s technology to predict affinity between drug candidates and therapeutic targets has the clear potential to change the drug discovery paradigm and to thus have a major impact on the success rate of the entire drug development process,” said Sacha Loiseau, Ph.D., partner at Elaia. “This is in strong adequation with Elaia’s strategy for the PSL Innovation Fund to invest in early-stage companies with disruptive technologies. We’re excited to be the first investor backing Aqemia and look forward to what lies ahead.”\\n\\nCommenting on the investment, Aqemia CEO Maximilien Levesque, Ph.D. said: “We’re very excited to close this first financing round led by Elaia. It supports our ambitious objective of spinning off the academic lab, recruiting a world-class team to build upon Aqemia’s deeptech asset, and above all proving our value: hunting molecules for the pharmaceutical industry with unprecedented accuracy and speed.” \\n\\nWith its first financing round, the company is looking to recruit the first members of its team. Specifically Levesque and COO Emmanuelle Martiano want to hire in silico drug hunters, software developer, and experts in generative artificial intelligence. ',\n",

The investment will accelerate the company in its mission to make the world’s capital markets more efficient.\\n\\nFounded in 2014, the Berlin-based startup provides a digital debt marketplace for consumer, SME, invoices, mortgages, and other forms of debts from banks and alternative lenders. \\n\\nCEO and founder of CrossLend Oliver Schimek explained: “Well-functioning debt capital markets are crucial for stability in Europe, yet investment banking in debt markets has mostly remained undisrupted by digitisation until now. The arteries of our financial system are increasingly threatening to clog, leading to severe economic restrictions for companies and individuals in Europe. CrossLend re-wires the debt market in the spirit of the European capital markets union.”\\n\\nBy making the assets available to a wide range of institutional investors, more capital flows into Europe’s economy and makes the lending and investment ecosystem more efficient, transparent, and profitable.\\n\\n“CrossLend has the potential to disrupt the lending ecosystem by making debt trading more transparent and efficient, while at the same time unleashing capital on a global scale. Asset Backed Securities (ABS) could finally lose their stigma of being opaque and highly toxic,” said Christian Nagel, partner at Earlybird.\\n\\nSchimek continued: “We are pleased about the long-term confidence of our investors. With their support, we are now taking an important step to further expanding our services to banks, investment funds, and insurance companies.”',\n",

Founded in 2012, the startup has developed integrated software and hardware solutions to help industrial companies innovate safely and efficiently. Current customers include PSA, Deme, Multraship, Brabo, Port of Antwerp, Katoen Natie and VOPAK. In its scale-up phase, the Antwerp-based business will focus on providing digital solutions for the port, petrochemical, and other complex industrial environments. One example is the development of Romware, a smart watch that prevents accidents on industrial sites. Jorik Rombouts, founder and CEO said: “From now on, we fully commit ourselves to Industry 4.0., a strategic choice that answers to a growing market demand in the more complex industry segments. This choice is reflected in the background and expertise of our new investors. They have taken over the shares from Michel Akkermans and replaced him in the Board of Directors.” Vic Swerts, founder of InvestLink commented: “The entrepreneurial spirit, the international customer portfolio, and the state-of-the-art technologies have convinced us to support Rombit’s growth.”',\n",
       " 'Threedium, a London-based startup developing a 3D visualisation platform, has raised €1 million in seed funding. The round was led by High-Tech Gründerfonds, with support from Kinisis Investment, Sandhutch, and George Zarifis. The startup has developed a 3D product configuration and visualisation platform that can be easily adopted by organisations of any size and budget. CEO Mike Charalambous explained the SaaS technology’s impact: “Before we started Threedium, everyone felt that 3D technology was expensive, slow-to-load and hard to implement. Threedium have disproved by providing 3D solutions across large and small-sized companies and creating activations across e-commerce sites, social media, e-retailers and through ad exchange platforms. Our mission is to continue our approach in democratising 3D web technologies for all brands, agencies, and individuals.” The software is already used by large enterprises in the UK such as Sainsburys, Douglas, Johnson & Johnson, and Mercedes to enhance their customers’ online experience, increase user engagement, and make their digital product display more life-like. Why does a more life-like product display matter? The sales and marketing value of such 3D imaging is impressive. Threedium’s chief commercial officer Lode Groosman provided some figures: “On average 3D display increases conversion rates by 30 percent, doubles the amount of time users spend on-site, enhances click-through rates by 300 percent and drops product returns by 18 percent.” Founded in 2017, Threedium currently has offices in London, Belgrade, and Cologne. The company will use the new funding to further develop its 3D platform and expand into Germany, US, and other European markets.',\n",

Founded in Bratislava, the company’s technology gives enterprise customers insight into complex business processes, such as order-to-cash, procure-to-pay, customer journey or service delivery, and how to improve them. Minit helps pinpoint and understand the sources of inefficiency, be they bottlenecks or compliance violations, ultimately suggesting how users can reduce costs and increase revenue. “Minit’s mission is to create fully transparent operations for large enterprises based on what is really going on in their business,” said Rasto Hlavac, founder and CEO. In a $200 million market that is set to surpass $1.4 billion by 2023, Minit distinguishes itself by providing clients with a bang for their buck in under a year. The fast ROI is attributed to the flexible business model, rapid implementation, and minimal training needs. Hlavac continued: “We empower people at every level, from the CEO to an office worker, to understand what is going on in the organization, and more importantly how they can make it better. We’re lucky to have the extensive operational experience of Target Global and strategic reach of Salesforce Ventures now supporting us, and we’re excited to see our next phase of growth.” Yaron Valler, general partner at Target Global said: “With a superior product that is already leading in a rapidly growing market, Minit’s potential is significant. Across every industry, businesses require the functional tools to streamline operations, and Minit’s easily integrated tool that empowers anyone in the business to visualise how they can improve their operations is impressive. We’re excited to be supporting the company in its next stage of growth and global expansion.” Currently Minit has teams in London, Eindhoven and Bratislava. The Series A will allow the company to add new product features, such as predictive analytics, simulations, and Minit cloud, and to expand into new markets, including the US.',\n",
       " 'Dublin-based startup evervault has raised a $3.2 million seed to fund its mission of making data privacy simple and accessible for all. The round was led by Sequoia Capital, with support from Kleiner Perkins, Frontline, and SV Angel, among others. Founded by Forbes’ 2018 30 Under 30, 19 year-old Shane Curran, evervault is building a cloud-based secure processing product: infrastructure that bridges secure cloud hardware and web/mobile applications, making it a product feature rather than a compliance issue. “Data is king, and the team at evervault is on a mission to solve the ‘how’ of ensuring data privacy. Their developer-first approach ensures that data privacy becomes part of the development fabric, instead of an afterthought left for compliance to troubleshoot,” said Mamoon Hamid, partner at Kleiner Perkins. The Irish company hosts a network of hardware-secured data processing enclaves which allows developers to easily deploy their applications in privacy cages — where information can be processed securely in hardware-hardened containers with strictly controlled access — without changing the way they build their software. Developers integrate with the evervault API through their publicly available developer SDKs for all major architectures and frameworks. Shane Curran, founder and CEO said, “It is disappointing that the data privacy toolkit for developers is still entirely lacklustre in 2019. The support and backing from some of the best investors in the world provides an exciting opportunity to accelerate us on our path to fundamentally re-architect how our personal data is handled. I believe we can start a generational shift in how we can approach these problems, by building the privacy tools necessary to support technology builders and creators.” Such a young CEO does indeed represent a new generation. The 19 year-old won the 2017 BT Young Scientist & Technology Exhibition for research in cryptography and data privacy while he was still in secondary school. “Shane has a special combination of clear vision, deep thoughtfulness, and insatiable curiosity,” said Stephanie Zhan, partner at Sequoia. “We are thrilled to partner with evervault at the seed, to solve for today’s massive data breaches and build simple developer tools for data privacy.”',\n",
       " 'Cambridge-based Healx, an AI-powered biotech company researching treatments for rare diseases, has raised a $56 million Series B led by Atomico, joined by Intel Capital, Global Brain and btov Partners. The investment enables the company to launch its global Rare Treatment Accelerator programme, as well as pursue ongoing research. Healx is innovating on the traditional drug discovery model, which takes several years and can cost billions of dollars. The traditional route is especially unfeasible for rare conditions, the research for which may not receive much funding. “Rare diseases affect over 400 million patients world-wide. Of the 7,000 rare diseases known today, 95 percent are still without an approved treatment. To date, it’s been families and patient groups who have had to become experts in the diseases affecting their loved ones and have often been the ones driving forward the efforts into finding new treatments,” said CEO and co-founder Dr. Tim Guilliams. With AI the discovery process is more efficient and more cost-effective. Healnet, Healx’s AI platform, delivers data-driven treatment predictions and shrinks the discovery-to-clinic timeline to as little as 24 months. The Rare Treatment Accelerator programme is an attempt to scale this impact across various diseases and communities around the world, working closely with patient communities to identify treatments. Healx’s mission is to advance 100 rare disease treatments towards the clinic by 2025. “With our unique combination of in-house R&D, industry collaborations, and now the Rare Treatment Accelerator, we look forward to supporting these groups in their mission,” continued Guilliams, referring to patient groups and their families and underscoring Healx’s patient-driven approach. The world’s leading platform on rare diseases, Healnet integrates scientific literature, clinical trial results, and proprietary data in the form of a biomedical knowledge graph, pinpointing the potential therapeutic relationships between drugs and diseases. Healx has already put its technology in collaboration with FRAXA Research Foundation to discover and test treatments for fragile X syndrome, the leading genetic cause of autism. Irina Haivas, principal at Atomico and board member of Healx said: “The current, expensive, trial-and-error-based model of drug discovery hasn’t changed in a century. And it especially fails rare disease patients. 50% of these patients are children, many living with highly debilitating symptoms. Healx has shown that doesn’t have to be the case, by combining AI with world-class pharmacological expertise and putting patients first. We believe that the new paradigm in drug discovery will emerge at the intersection of technology, data, and biology, and we’re confident that Healx’s team is paving the way to a new gold standard in rare disease treatment discovery.” The new investment follows a $10 million Series A last year, which allowed for senior executive hires and doubling the overall headcount of the team.',\n",

Leading companies including Stripe, Slack, Intuit, Discovery Inc., Sephora, Lacoste, LVMH, and Birchbox use Algolia to deliver Google-like search experience within their branded websites. For Algolia clients, it’s all about the consumer’s experience. Nick Maupin, product manager at Under Armour attested to the platform’s elegant service: “Delivering a fast, relevant experience to our online customers is a top priority. With Algolia, Under Armour has been able to move from a manual, time-intensive search tool to a fast, intuitive and insight-driven search experience to deliver what our customers are searching for.” Currently over 8,000 companies use the platform, which runs 70 billion search queries per month. In addition to the search-as-a-service component, there are a suite of developer-friendly APIs as well as analytics, personalisation, and A/B testing capabilities. Nicolas Dessaigne, co-founder and CEO, said: “For too long, organizations have had to choose between building resource-intensive search tools by themselves and using lower cost, but inflexible, set-it-and-forget-it search solutions. Algolia solves for both by removing the cost and complexity of building search while empowering businesses to create tailored experiences that engage and delight customers. Our rapid growth underscores both the market’s need to deliver amazing consumer experiences, and Algolia’s ability to help customers achieve these experiences.” The massive investment will accelerate the company’s current expansion across the US, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The funding will also support its research and development teams to continue evolving the search platform, focusing specifically on personalisation, machine learning, and voice search capabilities.',\n",

More specifically, the Cashforce technology improves “clients’ ability to aggregate disparate data sets across their enterprise to help better manage their working capital and more accurately predict through algorithmic techniques their potential liquidity exposure,” says Ron Chakravarti, managing director at Citi Ventures. Corné Jansen, managing director of INKEF Capital, explained further: “With the help of Cashforce’s technology, the way cash flow forecasts are generated and working capital is managed can be radically transformed.

Offices in Zurich and Singapore are already in the pipeline. Executive Chairman Michel Akkermans and CEO Nicolas Christiaen commented on the success so far and the opportunity ahead: “Cash forecasting still remains one of the most important challenges for treasurers worldwide.

       " 'Rob Surgical has raised €5 million from Dutch holding company, Scranton Enterprises, to continue developing its robotic surgery technology, finish the validation process, and bring the product to market. The medtech startup wants to universalise high-precision surgery. Its engineers have designed a flexible, modular, and open robotic platform that “will improve the effectiveness of today’s robotic surgery and make it accessible to more hospitals around the world,” says Jaume Amat, CEO of Rob Surgical and president of Catalonia Bio & HealthTech. “We will make possible combined manual and robotic surgery, what we like to call hybrid minimum invasive surgery (HMIS).” The proprietary system is known as Bitrack, and serves as an alternative to the current laparoscopy surgical robot, Da Vinci. Amat explained the benefits of the Bitrack system, claiming, “Our value proposition […] is based on three cornerstones: high precision benefitting the patient, superior usability for the surgeon, and a significant total cost of ownership reduction benefiting the hospitals.” The new robot has already been validated through testing at the Mayo Clinic in the US and at Barcelona university hospitals, Vall d’Hebron and Germans Trias. Bitrack still needs a CE marking, a certification mark that indicates compliance with health, safety, and environmental protection standards in Europe. The latest investment will help with that. Amat estimates the CE process to take about 30 months. The funding will also help the company follow through on a few more goals before 2021: build three new units to finalise the validation and manufacturing process, expand the corporate and engineering teams, and complete the final safety trials. Founded in 2012, Rob Surgical was a spin-off of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) and the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC). The founding team members are Dr. Josep Amat, Dr. Alícia Casals, Dr. Manel Frigola and Jaume Amat.

In a statement from BBVA, the tools help “build trusting and mutually beneficial relationships” between individuals and businesses. In the context of data consent and tailored advertising, this symbiotic relationship is like so: customers only see highly-personalized ads; businesses can reach out to highly-targeted groups of consumers, who all remain anonymous. Sergio Maldonado, CEO and co-founder of PrivacyCloud, said the new investment will allow the company to “keep moving forward in reformulating current marketing, sales, and customer loyalty building practices.” La Sexta Opción is comprised of 40 professionals, coordinated by global law firm ILP Abogados and Fundación Villacellino.

The company already plans to expand further to Hong Kong and Singapore. Two fortuitous events in 2019 have laid the foundation for this move across the globe. First, TrueLayer was selected by the UK’s Department of International Trade to pilot its ‘fintech bridge’ programme to Australia. Then in June, the company closed a $35 million funding round led by Tencent and Temasek. With its $47 million to date, the UK fintech is building a range of APIs that provide clients with an interface to customer data and online payments. The company has already expanded to Germany, France, Italy, and Spain and partnered with companies including Monzo, Zopa, ClearScore, Plum, Emma, CreditLadder, Canopy, and ANNA Money. Thousands of developers are actively developing applications on its platform. Marie Steinthaler, who will be the head of APAC, said: “TrueLayer is entering Australia at the perfect time: open banking is set to explode much in the same way it has in the UK. We were at the forefront of this sea-change in Europe, and we are very excited to bring our developer-friendly API platform to Australia and the wider APAC region in quick succession.

Hiro Capital is its name, and today it launches a €100 million fund from its bases in London and Luxembourg. The founding team consists of Ian Livingstone CBE, co-founder of Games Workshop; Luke Alvarez, co-founder of Inspired Entertainment; and Cherry Freeman, co-founder of LoveCrafts. The global gaming, e-sports, and digital sports sectors total around $200 billion globally. According to a statement from the new VC, Europe has the potential to be world-leading force in the sector, except that ventures here are woefully underfunded. Last year, Europe produced 123 PC and console games, compared to Asia’s 103 and the US’ 78. Half of the top 30 mobile games worldwide are developed in the UK or Europe. In the UK alone, there are 2,500 games studios. Only 2 percent of these studios receive any form of VC money. Hiro Capital wants to infuse these sectors and studios with the attention and funding they deserve. “Through investing and nurturing the right talent in Europe and the UK, our goal is to generate great returns for our investors and bring much-needed capital to the industry. We are focused on innovative games and games technologies. We’re gamers at heart and strongly believe in the positive power of play culturally, socially and economically,” said Ian Livingstone, Partner. The firm will target the post-seed funding gap, focusing on Series A and Series B investments in about 20 companies. Hiro will also look for sector-specific applications of cloud, mobile, streaming, big data, AI, wearables, AR and VR technologies. Commenting on the unique potential ahead, Cherry Freeman said: “The scaling opportunities combined with the capital efficiency in the games and sports technology sectors make it a uniquely exciting arena. You can start from nothing and end up on a billion handsets in a year. If you’ve got an idea, you can talk to the entire planet. There are very few sectors which are totally global, totally consumer facing and instantly scalable and our new fund will be looking to tap into this potential to discover the next-generation of trailblazers. The Hiro team have founded games, sports and tech startups worth over $5 billion between us. We support our entrepreneurs on their heroic journeys from startups to global stars.”',\n",

Parkwalk, 24Haymarket, and University of Bristol Enterprise Fund III also contributed. Mogrify’s platform takes a systematic, big-data approach to cell conversion research. Its proprietary technology allows scientists to transform any mature human cell directly into another type of cell, without going through a stem cell, which the company says ensures a safer, more efficient, and scalable process. Specifically, the platform is developing cell therapies that address musculoskeletal, auto-immune, cancer immunotherapy, ocular and respiratory diseases. “The science and technology base Mogrify are building is truly unique and disruptive. If successful, the positive effect on patient outcomes across a wide range of diseases will be staggering,” said Alastair Kilgour, Chief Investment Officer at Parkwalk. Just launched in February 2019, the company’s ample funding proves it has impressed the original investors thus far. Alice Newcombe-Ellis, founder of Ahren Innovation Capital said: “The company has grown rapidly since February, appointing a world-class management team and delivering strongly against its business plans. We look forward to supporting Mogrify as it continues to go from strength to strength.” The Series A will support various internal therapy programs as well as the out-licensing of intellectual property around cell conversions. The headcount of the Cambridge headquarters is tripling to 60, with new recruits for the commercial, operational, and scientific teams. Commenting on the investment round, Mogrify’s CEO Dr. Darrin M.

Funded mainly from local angel investors, TechMinsk will invest in the most promising local startups, up to $50,000 for up to eight percent equity. The startups then enter a ten-week acceleration program that covers every facet of launching a business, from product-market fit to company culture, through hands-on activities and mentorship. In an added boost to the homegrown effort, the organisation has also secured a partnership with Google Launchpad, Google’s global acceleration program, wherein Google experts share specific expertise and technology with AI-first startups. The first batch of TechMinsk-funded projects are all built on AI but otherwise span a range of sectors: digital health, design, SaaS, travel, and areas of education and entertainment. Google isn’t the only form of “outside” support, however. TechMinsk is also supported by the US Agency for International Development, which helped establish the organisation back in 2013. The first batch of startups kicked off the acceleration program last week and will present their businesses at a final “demo day” event on December 10. TechMinsk aims to run two batches per year; the next one will start spring 2020.

LifeX is one of the largest networks of co-living homes in Europe. The company organises large apartments in attractive neighborhoods, designs the interior in the popular Nordic aesthetic, provides weekly cleaning services, and does not require any rigid commitment on the part of residents. Membership is flexible, unlike traditional long-term leases. The added bonus is the community of fellow members, who create a built-in social network for those facing a new city alone. In an unprecedented age of professional flexibility, globalised workforces, and the digital nomad, young people are moving across countries and continents to build lives around their careers. LifeX aims to serve exactly this demographic of “expat” young professionals. The company is doing so by partnering with the employers: fast-growing startups like N26, Pleo, and Delivery Hero, who are trying to attract foreign talent and have a vested interest in making relocation as convenient as possible. LifeX apartments are currently available in Copenhagen, Berlin, London, Paris, Munich, and Vienna, with more than 300 members from over 50 countries. Originally, though, the co-living idea came from the founders’ personal experience. LifeX co-founder Ritu Jain explained: “While moving from San Francisco back to Copenhagen, Denmark we struggled to find a place to call home. In the end we decided to try and rent a big flat in the city centre, make it into a beautiful Nordic-style home and see if anyone was interested in sharing it. We told a few of our coworkers about it, and the first home was full in a matter of days. That was just two years ago. Now we have more than 50 co-living homes in six European cities, a thriving and happy community of international members.

       " 'Einride, the Swedish company developing sustainable, self-driving vehicles, has raised $25 million in Series A funding. The round was led by EQT Ventures and NordicNinja VC, with support from Ericsson Ventures, Norrsken Foundation, Plum Alley Investments, and Plug and Play Ventures. The Stockholm-based startup is a pioneer in AET(Autonomous Electric Transport)-systems, with specific development around road freight transport as opposed to personal vehicles. The trucks run on electricity and drive autonomously; the futuristic design does not even include room for a human driver or passenger. “Einride is taking on the huge challenge of revolutionising the jurassic global transportation market by automating and electrifying transportation to reduce CO2 emissions. Einride’s approach of tying together software and hardware to take transportation into the future is by far one of the most ambitious I’ve seen as an investor in Europe,” said Ted Persson, operating partner and investment advisor at EQT Ventures. Current customer deals include supermarket chain Lidl, unnamed US-based transport companies, and the logistics provider DB Schenker, which now has an all-electric, autonomous truck at its facility in Sweden. This truck, the Einride pod, was the world’s first to operate commercially with a permit on a public road. Commenting on the new investment, Einride founder and CEO Robert Falck said: “Our ambition is to disrupt the transport industry and closing our series A brings us one step closer to that goal. The funding will allow us to start expanding in the US, deliver on our technology road map and to meet rapidly increasing customer demand.” The company was founded in 2016 by Falck, Linnéa Kornehed, and Filip Lilja.',\n",
       " 'New Vector has announced $8.5 million in funding to scale its open-source, secure communication network, a bid to revolutionise data privacy and ownership in the messaging app space. The investments come from European VCs who specialize in enterprise tech: Notion Capital, Dawn and firstminute capital. Necessary for understanding New Vector’s business is to first understand Matrix. Matrix is an open-source project, building a global network for decentralised communication. Users can collaborate securely via end-to-end encryption, and notably, they retain all ownership and control over their data. With a system poised to challenge incumbent messaging giants such as WhatsApp and Slack, the original Matrix developers founded a company that could drive its commercial adoption: New Vector. That was in 2017. Since then the Matrix network has grown 400 percent — to 11 million users with 40,000 deployments, including the French government, the US government, Wikimedia, and KDE, the international free software community. New Vector CEO and Matrix co-founder Matthew Hodgson believes this growth suggests Matrix-based apps will eventually dominate the market. “Ensuring there are Matrix apps out there which provide a credible alternative to Slack and WhatsApp will make it the natural successor to today’s instant messaging applications,” he said. Jos White of Notion Capital echoed Hodgson and commented on the importance of the technology: “At last the market has an alternative with the New Vector services that are based off the Matrix protocol offering open standards and delivering complete data ownership and security. It feels like the full power and promise of the Internet is being returned to its rightful place — the user — and we couldn’t be more excited about the potential for this exceptional team.” Henry Mason of Dawn Capital said: “With this funding New Vector can capitalise on the significant inbound interest already received from governments and security-conscious enterprises.” Brent Hoberman, co-founder of firstminute capital added: “The US has seen its fair share of successful messaging platforms. We are excited to back the first European-led team in this space since Skype.”',\n",

Healthy.Capital is investing €600,000 to test the app in the real word: Orikami will bring its new form of care to the first 25,000 patients. The company’s software, which has been “medically validated,” translates real patient data into digital treatment support called digital biomarkers. These biomarkers act as indicators to medical specialists, who can then prescribe medication more effectively. Not only does the Orikami approach save time and resources of the medical and pharmaceutical communities, but it saves patients from enduring ineffective and often expensive treatments. The technology is particularly suited for tracking complex chronic illnesses, such as neurologic disorders like Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinsons.\\n\\nDouwe Jippes, managing partner at Healthy.Capital commented: “Digital biomarkers are the basis for moving towards more personalized health care. Orikami is the leader in Europe when it comes to the development of validated digital biomarkers. After an in-depth analysis of the European sector, one proposition stood out head and shoulders above the rest: Orikami.” Bram den Teuling, founder of Orikami said, “Recognizing data patterns by continually monitoring the patient delivers insights that help when it comes to offering customized medical treatments. Our information is used to make important decisions and therefore it’s crucial that our products are clinically validated and certified. The past five years have given us significant experience with those processes. That makes us unique in the market. We are also actively looking for new collaborations with pharmaceutical companies.”',\n",

The Dublin-based company, founded in 2017, has developed a voice-activated smart-home customer service platform to reduce stress for residents and support teams alike. Strategy Analytics and International Telecommunications Union (ITU) predicts that by 2022 there will be 4.3 billion devices in our homes. The volume of customer support requests regarding these devices would be even more staggering; some elements of a smart home might make the resident feel quite dumb. That’s exactly what Sweepr is trying to mitigate. The platform delivers customized support tailored not only to the context of the problem, but also to the technical skill of the customer, in the form of verbal instructions, pictures, and video. “Sweepr’s voice activated platform has the potential to totally transform customer experience. The millions of support calls happening globally, which frustrate customers and cost service providers billions each year, could be dramatically reduced as the technology enables consumers to find out what’s wrong in real-time,” said Nicola McClafferty, investment director with Draper Esprit. Sweepr CEO Alan Coleman commented on the technology’s role in advancing the smart-home industry: “Customer support needs to evolve to accommodate the growing complexity of our connected home environments. Sweepr’s early deployments have confirmed that the care industry is ready to be transformed by moving the support from within a traditional call center to within the home itself.”',\n",

As the retail sector adjusts to more experiential-based shopping and changing criteria for brand loyalty, Critizr has introduced a feedback management system that allows retailers and brands to connect with their customers. The company partners with over 80 European companies in 25 countries across retail, banking, travel, entertainment and hospitality. In France alone, it connects to over 30,000 points of sale.\\n\\nThe CRM pulls customer interactions from multiple online channels into a single hub, and can even route specific feedback to the appropriate branch of a large enterprise. Easy and immediate access to this feedback leads to a host of claimed benefits for Critizr users: an optimised customer experience, stronger customer relationships, higher rates of customer loyalty, an improved online reputation and NPS score – and ultimately, increased revenues.\\n\\nLaurel Bowden of 83North emphasized these results: “Customer experience at storefront level is critical for retail success. We are very impressed how Critizr empowers store managers, in their daily routine with the right tools, and as a result, has significant impact on some of the most important business metrics such as revenue, NPS, purchase frequency and churn.”\\n\\nNicolas Hammer, CEO and co-founder of Critizr said: “83North has enabled many fast-growing software companies to realise their ambition and take big strides forward in their development.

Founded in 2014 by CEO Jaime Jorge and CTO João Caxaria, Codacy is a SaaS platform that automates code review, which not only increases efficiency of individual developers but also standardises software quality across sprawling enterprise teams. Jorge explained the pressing need for Codacy’s product: “Large enterprises, employing thousands of developers distributed across the globe, are seeking ways to enable their engineering teams to become more productive and predictable. With estimates showing that roughly 42 percent of developers’ time is spent maintaining code, we’re seeing massive demand for quality standardization in the development cycle.” The startup claims to help companies avoid technical debt, shrink productivity gaps, streamline product releases, and boost bottom lines. All of these benefits are achieved through analysis of over 30 billion lines of code per day, across more than 450 customers. The new funding will go toward product development and commercial initiatives around the world. In the past year, the company opened a US headquarters in New York City as well as an office in the Bay Area, where its global head of sales is now based. To keep up with the rapidly scaling enterprise market, Codacy is preparing to deploy on Kubernetes for all of its cloud and on-premise users, while continuing to release additional programming language support and expand features within the GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket environments.',\n",
       " 'FAZUA, the Munich-based startup that develops drive systems for e-bikes, has announced €15 million in growth financing, led by UVC Partners. The European Investment Bank (EIB) loaned €12 million in venture debt, backed by the European Fund for Strategic Investments. A while before the micromobility trend manifested as rentable street scooters, FAZUA began in 2013 as a manufacturer of lightweight e-bike drive systems. The product is surprisingly compact: the system, including motor and battery, fits in the down tubes of traditional bicycles. (The down tube is the diagonal bar that essentially connects the handlebars to the pedals.) Now over 35 European manufacturers are using the system in the e-mountain, e-urban, e-gravel, and e-racing bike segments. The company’s growth and market leadership convinced investors to participate in the latest round. “With its consistent and profitable growth since our first investment in 2017, we are proud to double down on FAZUA as it increases its footprint in the billion-euro and fast-growing e-bike market,” said Benjamin Erhart of UVC Partners. The funding will help FAZUA expand its product range beyond the original drive system explained above, and CEO Fabian Reuter stressed the importance of maintaining quality as the company scales. Reuter said: “The capital provided by the EIB is the ideal financing instrument for us in our current business phase. In addition to the ‘evation’ drive system, which has already been very successfully launched on the market, we can now invest even more in the expansion of our product range. It is crucial for us to maintain our successful business model with the highest quality standards, production under our own roof in Germany and reliable partners, most of whom also come from Europe.”',\n",

As a reward for its groundbreaking biomedical technology, Cyprio received an equity-free $50,000 cash grant to scale the business. Based in Paris, the startup is redefining 3D cell research and tissue engineering, developing better predictive research tools for testing drug efficacy and toxicity in the human liver. The proprietary technology is called “BioPearl,” and it allows users to create 3D cellular models of human tissue. The event aims to raise the profile and accelerate the growth of women-led healthtech startups, which have received just 9.7 percent of VC digital health funding since 2011. Women Who Tech is a nonprofit that provides capital, mentoring, access to top investors, and other resources to female tech entrepreneurs who fall on the other side of the funding gap. Noushin Dianat, CEO and co-founder of Cyprio commented: “I am so grateful to the jury, JLABS, and Women Who Tech for their support of the pitch process, and to the Mayor of Paris for organising the event. The prize is so meaningful to me for the recognition it brings to women-led companies. I truly appreciate what Women Who Tech does to help normalise the culture of being a founder and a woman.” The founder of Women Who Tech spoke about the organisation’s mission and Cyprio’s win: “Women Who Tech is shaking up a culture and economy that’s made it exceedingly challenging for women-led startups to raise capital. We’re thrilled to award the grand prize to Cyprio who is revolutionising the tissue engineering field so more patients waiting for liver transplants will survive.” The Women Startup Challenge is supported by Craig Newmark Philanthropies, Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JLABS, the office of the Mayor of Paris, Rad Campaign, Pineapple Fund, Google, Donna Griffit Storyteller, Spool, and V3 Broadsuite, among others.',\n",

The total valuation of its 23 software companies has surpassed $1 billion. All 23 of these companies eFounders built from scratch.

The group works together over 18 months to transform the idea into a viable business, building the first version of the product and hiring 10 to 15 team members. Formed into a company, the project is then presented to investors and can reach financial and operational independence from the studio. About four to five of these ventures launch each year. “Our mission is to build the tools used by the next generation of people at work.

Based dually in Copenhagen and Barcelona, Abzu is creating a B2B SaaS platform to make AI technology and solutions more commercially accessible. In the popular parlance of today, the company is trying to “democratize” artificial intelligence. “If AI is to be used right and find a foothold, it’s important that the users of our platform find it simple and cheap. The truth is that most neural networks and deep-learning solutions today are consequently very complicated to establish and expensive. We want to challenge that,” said Abzu CEO Casper Wilstrup. The company’s platform is able to work with limited datasets and self-learn from past experience. Without the need for a large pool of data or investment in manual data science processes, smaller companies can now employ and enjoy the benefits of AI. “Based on our technology, many more companies — also those with very little data — will be able to build advanced AI models to help their business. That’s a game changer that will cut into the technological lead held by such giants as Google, Apple, and Amazon,” Wilstrup continued. Indeed, the company aims to put Europe on the map when it comes to AI, a space largely dominated by American and Chinese companies. Timo Tirkkonen, a partner at Inventure and member of Abzu’s board spoke to this ambition: “Europe has not had the first move advantage in the AI space, but it is home to a world class talent pool and a harmonized internal market. Those factors combined allow us to achieve a unique position as horizontal providers of artificial intelligence. We want to create a customer-centric product, built around the individuals’ needs for information and privacy, that will become a global industry standard.” Founded in February 2018, Abzu has raised €2.85 million to date. The SaaS platform is expected to launch in April 2020.',\n",
       " 'Finnish IoT sensor startup Soil Scout has secured a late-seed funding round led by Husqvarna Group. Soil Scout plans to use the funding to scale production so it can help more farmers, sports venues, and managers of green spaces around the world better manage their water resources. The startup has developed a singular system for water management that outperforms traditional solutions. Soil Scout’s sensor is the first to transmit critical soil data wirelessly from underground in real time. The system transmits data about moisture, temperature, and salinity from two meters below the surface. Not only that, the system can run for up to 20 years without any maintenance. Soil Scout’s roots begin with one man and his invention. A 19th generation farmer and doctor in agrotechnology, Johannes Tiusanen built the system to give farmers the data they need for precise agricultural observations, which help them not only conserve water resources but also increase long-term yields on their land. Tiusanen explained the need for more statistical precision in an age-old practice such as farming: “Quite contradictory to what people think, precipitation actually is inadequate, even here in Finland: we have plenty of water, but agronomically in the wrong place. When it comes to agriculture, topography, draining and soil composition can lead to different parts of the same field having a substantially different yield potential. At Soil Scout, we have built a future-proof below-ground monitoring solution that can stay in operation and in-situ for decades.” The leading investor Husqvarna Group is a global producer of outdoor power products and innovative solutions for forest, park, and garden care. Husqvarna sells its products to consumers and professionals in more than 100 countries. The firm’s vice president of Accelerated Innovation & Venturing Björn Axling said, “We were particularly impressed with Soil Scout’s track record, with high-profile sports grounds like Wembley Stadium and Citizens Bank Park (home to the Philadelphia Phillies) already utilizing the system.” Soil Scout’s CEO Jalmari Talola commented on the investment: “We are extremely excited about the recognition from Husqvarna as they have over a century’s worth of experience in the field and understand the need for water management. This funding is important for us as it allows us to improve our collaboration with new and existing partners and customers, as well as extend our product portfolio.”',\n",

Taneli Tikka, Mikko Riikkinen, and Stefano Mosconi all have a sober but aspirational outlook on the state of tech in Finland. Simply put, it is not fulfilling its potential.\\n\\n“The Finnish startup ecosystem has everything other than the startups. We have expertise, coworking facilities, accelerators, subsidies, investors. But if a billion euros invested did not generate more than eighteen startups exceeding €10 million in revenue, then perhaps it is high time to try something new,” says Riikkinen, a fintech expert and doctoral researcher at the University of Tampere. Past investments and business models in Finland have had such unimpressive performance that the founders see the country losing its best people to more attractive startup scenes. \\n\\n“Finnish talent is constantly flowing abroad, so I want to show myself that there can be another direction,” said Mosconi, a native Italian and co-founder of Jolla mobile phones. Their answer? To launch the first venture builder in the Nordics. A venture builder, also known as a startup studio, tests and scales new business ideas until those ideas are viable enough for investment. Once funding is secured, either from the venture builder or elsewhere, the offspring business can set out as an independent company. Berlin-based Rocket Internet is a famous example of such a model.\\n Unlike the sky-high ROI expectations of many venture capitalist firms, 52nd Ventures has its sights set on a more realistic, middle-distance goal. It aims to populate the Finnish ecosystem with enough startups that have over €10 million in revenue (what the firm calls “reindeer”), so that the scene is ripe enough for billion-euro unicorns to eventually emerge. “We want to create a culture of testing and collegial learning to build startups that Supercell has succeeded in doing for games. This requires not only large financial resources but also a large community of experts. We believe that in Finland we have the opportunity to both,” said Taneli Tikka.',\n",
       " 'London-based Deliveroo announced that the company’s sales rose by £200 million in 2018. The growth is hard to miss. The food delivery platform was named Europe’s second-fastest growing company by the Financial Times, and was the first to top Deloitte’s UK Fast 50 two years in a row. Overall global sales rose to £476 million, an increase of 72 percent from the year before. Gross profit jumped 42 percent to £91 million. Deliveroo attributes this jump to increased order volumes, an enhanced customer offering, and continued growth in mature markets. In 2018 Deliveroo both permeated existing markets and also expanded into new ones. The service opened in 250 new towns and cities. Then last fall, Deliveroo launched in two countries: Taiwan and Kuwait. The company has used its growth to reinvest in itself, its partners, and delivery riders. Indeed, the service has developed far from its humble A-to-B food delivery beginnings, and its benefits seem to spread far beyond the company. The company devoted £18 million to its technology in 2018 alone, and expanded its operations by inviting restaurants that employ their own delivery fleets. Marketplace+ gives these restaurants access to the Deliveroo customer base. The move added 7,000 partner restaurants to the platform within six months, 2,000 more than predicted. In turn, Deliveroo boosts individual restaurants’ business as well as local economies. Independent analysis by Capital Economics shows that Deliveroo enabled UK restaurant partners to boost their sales by £1 billion in 2018, including £320 million for independent restaurants. The study also found that the company has helped create 25,000 jobs in UK’s restaurant sector since it launched in 2013. As for Deliveroo riders, they receive free insurance and access to hundreds of online courses, so that they stay safe on the roads and can continue their education or professional development. Will Shu, co-founder and CEO said, “We’re focused on our mission of becoming the definitive food company, and we’ve continued to invest heavily in expansion, technology, and new products to meet this ambition. We are leading the field in innovation in food delivery, helping our restaurant partners to boost their sales and providing more well-paid work for riders.” There’s bound to be more growth, evolution, and impact in the coming years, given the recent $575 million round led by Amazon, which brings Deliveroo’s total funding to over $1.5 billion. Shu believes “this is just the beginning.” He continued, “I can’t wait to work with new great local restaurants to deliver meals to millions of more customers around the globe.”',\n",

       " 'Munich-based wealthpilot, a digital solution for financial advisors, has raised €2.6 million from new and existing investors, including Bayern Kapital, the venture capital organization of Bavaria. The fintech startup’s hybrid approach to wealth management combines personalized advice with software-as-a-service (SaaS), allowing customers to bring their personal advisory services into the 21st century. Such customers include financial advisors, asset managers, family offices, banks, and broker pools. wealthpilot does not intend its product strictly for professionals, though. Stephan Schug, one of the founders, explains that the company wants to democratise wealth management: “No matter their financial situation, we want our clients to be able to use the financial advisory and planning tools, which are usually only available to very wealthy persons. Thus, we aim to make a professional family office and financial planning approach accessible to a much broader audience.” Currently users rely on the platform to analyse more than €12 billion of financial assets, a total that has tripled in size since August 2018. The company’s growth convinced Bayern Kapital to invest a second time. Dr. Georg Ried, managing director at Bayern Kapital said, “Since our initial investment last year, wealthpilot has achieved substantial growth. The growth momentum is impressive. High-quality financial advisory services based on a sophisticated yet easy-to-use SaaS platform are in demand among financial advisors and asset managers. wealthpilot’s solution allows them to save time, which they can instead use to personally advise their clients. We are happy to join this current financing round to support wealthpilot’s continued growth.” The fresh funding will help further develop the software’s main functions: automated aggregation and analysis of financial data as well as smart scenario analyses for financial advisors and private customers. It will also enable the development of mobile apps for iOS and Android, the growth of the sales and marketing teams, and internationalization efforts.',\n",
       " 'UK-based SenSat has raised a $10 million Series A round to further develop its AI mapping technology with an eye on digitising new markets and promoting sustainability at the same time. The round was led by Tencent, with participation from Sistema Venture Capital. The primary (or initial) market for SenSat’s Mapp® product is infrastructure, one of the least digitised sectors in the global economy. Inefficiencies in infrastructure not only hinder social function and economic growth, but also contribute to waste and environmental damage. Harry Atkinson, co-founder and Chief Data Officer of SenSat explained: “Infrastructure is the only sector to have had a 0% net productivity increase since the 1960s, with a history of inefficiencies in doing business, contributing to a staggering 61% of total UK waste. The result is an estimated $5.2 trillion direct economic loss per year. Knowing this, we see a huge opportunity in allowing computers and AI to analyse the real world in order to help us grow more sustainably.” Mapp® creates digital representations of real world locations (otherwise known as “digital twins”) and captures real-time data sets from a variety of sources. The result is an accurate, digital copy of the real world in a machine-readable format. By enabling offline industries to make smarter decisions and more accurate analysis, SenSat hopes to drive improvements in safety, cost-efficiency, waste generation, project collaboration, and carbon reduction. “SenSat has a simple but profound goal: to build the third platform, an intelligent eco-system that translates the real world into a version understandable to AI. This technology will help us to build a more sustainable future, using the wealth of new insight to help humans make better decisions. Our plan is to first focus on perfecting our human controlled digital twin technology, so we can help to transform the way we deliver infrastructure,” said James Dean, co-founder and CEO of SenSat. In conjunction with the Murphy Group for the National Grid, SenSat digitised a 52 kilometer underground transmission line from the Triton Knoll offshore wind farm project. Time on site was reduced by 200%, and the company claims their less invasive methods greatly reduced the impact on local wildlife. The new funding will go toward the company’s team, allowing SenSat to grow its London set of 30 experts to more than 90 over the next year, focusing on data scientists, mathematicians, software developers, and other creative problem solvers.',\n",
       " 'Mainframe Industries, a pan-Nordic game venture with studios in Helsinki and Reykjavik, launched today with a €2 million seed round from early-stage tech and gaming investors such as Maki.vs, Play Ventures, Crowberry Capital, and Sisu Game Ventures. Thirteen veteran game developers bound together to create Mainframe Industries, with a shared mission to create the first open world, social sandbox MMO for cloud gaming — or as co-founder and CEO Thor Gunnarsson put it, “to build the game we’ve been preparing for our whole lives.” The group believes cloud gaming, which promises friction-free play from social networks and streaming platforms on any device, will usher in a new era of creativity and play for developers and gamers alike. Gunnarsson explained: “For Mainframe, the ability to deliver to all platforms a level of immersion and world simulation typically only seen in high-end PC games means that the visual gap between devices disappears as we move to the cloud. And we see tremendous potential in the expansive computing and storage capacity of the cloud. We can make bigger and better games with more complex physics simulation, AI, and character systems to deliver a fresh gaming experience unbounded by the constraints of individual platforms.” Commenting on the opportunity that comes with advances in network technology, Ilkka Kivimäki\\u200b, founding partner at Maki.vc said: “We are firm believers that the global gaming industry will once again be redefined as 5G will allow wireless gaming with low and consistent latency, benefitting gamers through improved discoverability, social enabling, and variety of content. The Nordics have showcased their strength in games before, and we find Mainframe’s exceptional, pan-Nordic team uniquely positioned to seize this new opportunity.”',\n",
       " 'Pitch, a collaborative presentation software from the creators of Wunderlist, is now available to select companies and teams. Thrive Capital invested $30 million in the new company, extending its original support for Wunderkind to the creators’ new venture. This investment comes just a year after a $19 million round from Index Ventures, BlueYard, Slack, and a flurry of angel investors. In that year, Pitch has doubled its team and hired senior executives including Philipp Hartmann (formerly Index Ventures, Raisin) as COO and Thom Cummings (formerly Grover, SoundCloud) as CMO. The idea behind Pitch is relatively simple, even if its technologies and integrations are advanced. Co-founder and CEO Christian Reber said, “Hundreds of millions of people rely on presentations to communicate their most important ideas, yet until now, they’ve been stuck with software that doesn’t work the way they need it to. Building a truly delightful user experience has always been our top priority. We’re super excited to get Pitch in the hands of teams so we can continue to learn from their feedback and build the presentation software they wish existed today.” Commenting on the decision to invest $30 million before launch, Joshua Kusher of Thrive Capital said: “We invest in fast-growing companies with big market potential, and Pitch is in a strong position to create a great product in a market that’s ripe for change. The demand for Pitch is already clear by the thousands of companies who have expressed interest in the limited preview. We believe in Pitch both because of the product vision but also because of the team. As investors in Wunderlist, we built strong relationships with the founders and are excited to work with them again at Pitch.” Over the next several months, Pitch will invite waitlist users to try the software, until it officially launches sometime in 2020. People can request access through the company’s website, pitch.com. > Also check out our interview with Reber on the funding round and more!',\n",
       " 'Berlin-based Grover, an electronics rental company and subscription service, secured new funding that is a mix of equity investors and debt capital. The €11 million equity is led by Augmentum Fintech, with support from existing investors coparion, Circularity Capital, Main Incubator (of Commerzbank Group), and Samsung Next. The €30 million debt is an addition to an existing deal with Varengold Bank, one of Germany’s major fintech banking partners. Grover has brought the access-over-ownership trend to the consumer electronics market, offering monthly rental subscriptions for all sorts of devices. Partnerships with big brand retailers such as MediaMarktSaturn, Gravis, and Tchibo – and its 300,000 registered users online – are mere precursors to its next stage of growth. The company plans to be represented in thousands of European electronic retail stores by the end of 2020. The fresh funding will help Grover both expand internationally and also expand its product range through new service offerings. The investment follows a 2018 Series A and brings the company’s total financing to over €100 million. Michael Cassau, CEO and founder of Grover said: “I am delighted with the confidence of our investment partners in Grover’s long-term business success. Our total funding amount is now in the three-digit million range, solidifying Grover’s position as a strong player in the German start-up ecosystem. This fresh funding will enable us to drive service and product innovation and bring Grover’s future-oriented rental service for consumer electronics to new and international customers beyond the German market.” Tim Levene, CEO of Augmentum Fintech expressed his confidence in the company: “Grover is a classic fintech disruptor. Its growth reflects a growing consumer trend for continued access to the latest electronic products. Consumers are now less concerned with outright-ownership and more concerned to have the latest device. This leads to shorter ‘ownership’ cycles. The Grover solution, growing rapidly in Germany, allows consumers to rent the latest products, and to return them at the optimal time for the consumer. We believe this way of accessing technology ‘ownership’ will be a growing trend across Europe.”',\n",
       " 'jobpal\\xa0has announced €2.5 million in funding from InReach Ventures, an AI-powered VC fund investing in early-stage European startups, and Acadian Ventures, a new early-stage VC firm founded by Jason Corsello, ex-CEO of Cornerstone.\\xa0 In an age when AI is making customer interactions more intuitive and user-centric, the world of recruitment is getting its own upgrade. jobpal creates AI chatbots for large enterprise businesses, who employ them to manage much of the recruiting process, from the first signs of candidate interest all the way to onboarding. Through machine learning and proprietary Natural Language Processing (NLP), jobpal automates interaction with potential hires, answering questions around the clock. “60 percent of the interactions our chatbots currently receive happen outside traditional business hours, which shows how important it is for enterprises to be available to respond to candidates 24/7,” said Luc Dudler, co-founder and CEO of the business.\\n\\nThe result is not only a more efficient recruitment process, but also a more effective one; the improved candidate experience gives job seekers a better impression of the employer and arguably increases their interest in being hired. Applicants can communicate whenever they want on platforms they use all the time, including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and SMS.\\xa0 In addition to big brand clients such as Airbus, Deutsche Telekom and McDonald’s, jobpal is also integrated with large-scale Human Capital Management suites including SAP SuccessFactors, Workday, Oracle (formerly Taleo), Avature, and Smartrecruiters.\\n\\nRoberto Bonanzinga, partner and co-founder of InReach Ventures, said, “Using our proprietary software (DIG), we look to discover and evaluate the most promising European start-ups. jobpal ticks all the boxes we look for when it comes to a great business idea coupled with the company’s ability to execute on the product.” Acadian Ventures is new on the European VC scene, with a mission to invest in companies that are using technology to redefine “the Future of Work,” improving work life from all angles.\\n\\nFounder and General Partner Jason Corsello commented on the firm’s investment: “Companies spend over $200 billion on recruiting worldwide, yet after 20 years of investment in recruiting technologies, we have barely moved the needle on the candidate experience. If Amazon can tailor our shopping experience and Spotify can personalise our playlist, companies should be able to create a unique candidate experience for all job seekers. We love that jobpal does this and more, delivering value to all stakeholders in the recruiting process. It’s not very often you find early-stage companies with such an iconic list of customers and we are excited to partner with jobpal to help accelerate its business and execute its vision.”',\n",
       " 'Deep learning company AnotherBrain has announced the first closing of their Series A, to the tune of €19 million. The company announced this investment round was led by a consortium of public and private investors, including SEB Alliance, Robinson Technologies, and existing shareholders Alpha Intelligence Capital, Daphni and Cathay Capital. The firm expects the extension of the round to “close oversubscribed by mid-December”. AnotherBrain has developed a unique technology, OrganicAI™, a deep learning artificial intelligence that mimics how the human brain learns and functions. In contrast to other AI-enabled technologies, OrganicAI™ does not rely on a corpus of big data for training. This design allows OrganicAI™ to operate at a lower cost and have fewer energy requirements compared to alternatives. OrganicAI™ is currently delivered as software, but the company plans to make the technology available soon on an AI-chip. AnotherBrain’s founder, Bruno Maisonnier, said: “When we started AnotherBrain, we decided to push forward the limits of what is possible thanks to our AI which goes beyond current AI. Our technology doesn’t rely on huge databases of previous examples, but instead analyses what it perceives and therefore can explain its decisions. Our ambition it to build a powerful and human-friendly AI, acceptable to companies (certification) and consumers (privacy). The first commercial solutions are currently tested by Fortune 100 companies, with general availability in early 2020. Our technology has the power to make every sensor an intelligent sensor sending back interpretation of signals rather than the flow of raw data. This will allow the generalization of AnotherBrain’s approach, in particular helping cars achieve full autonomous driving (Level 5) by the middle of the next decade.” Prior to founding AnotherBrain, Maisonnier was known as the serial innovator, founder and chairman of Aldebaran Robotics, the developer of humanoid robots Pepper and Nao. In 2015, Aldebaran Robotics was acquired by SoftBank Group. AnotherBrain was founded and raised its first seed round of €11 million in 2017. This new announcement brings AnotherBrain’s total financing to date to €35 million. According to Francois-Xavier Meyer, VP Investments SEB Alliance: “We have followed the progress of AnotherBrain since its inception. The technology is genuinely breakthrough and will deliver benefits which traditional AI (Machine Learning) cannot, such as explainability, independence from the cloud (making it more private and secure), and reduced energy consumption. First initial customer deployments have demonstrated AnotherBrain’s strong potential in particular in the field of Industry 4.0”. Currently, Paris-based AnotherBrain has 38 employees. According to the firm’s website, “Kindness and responsibility are at the heart of every person in our team to keep up with the challenges of AI today and tomorrow.”',\n",
       " 'Berlin-born AMBOSS, a knowledge platform for medical professionals, has raised a €30 M Series B to fuel its international rollout and app development. Investment firms Partech and Target Global led the round, with support from existing investors Cherry Ventures, Wellington Partners, and Holtzbrinck Digital. Since its last funding in 2017, AMBOSS has evolved from an exam preparation tool for German medical students to a global platform for doctors, giving more than 500,000 users access to the latest medical knowledge. Institutions around the world are using AMBOSS to support doctors and medical students, including two of the largest hospital groups in Europe and more than 50 medical schools, including the New York University School of Medicine (NYU). In addition to rolling out the platform worldwide, the medtech company will use the funds to further invest in its smart guidance application, which provides evidence-based information to help clinicians make decisions at the point of care.\\n\\nBenedikt Hochkirchen, co-CEO of AMBOSS said, “Medical knowledge is exploding and it is almost impossible for doctors to quickly obtain reliable clinical information. Our mission is to connect every doctor with precise medical knowledge to provide the best possible care. This new funding will allow us to make a meaningful contribution to global health.” Omri Benayoun, General Partner at Partech commented: ”Better-structured medical knowledge is the foundation to improve healthcare. Physicians and students work in a time-constrained environment, where knowledge sources are proliferating, and are often complex to access and apply. At AMBOSS, software engineers, doctors, and scientists leverage technology to bring simplicity to medical knowledge modelling and delivery. We are impressed by the unique cutting-edge approach of AMBOSS to pioneer faster breakthroughs and are excited to partner with the visionary and passionate team, which is impacting global health positively.”',\n",
       " 'Shapr3d, the first mobile 3D modeling app for iPad Pro, announced a $6 million series A round from Point Nine Capital and Creandum, two European early-stage VC firms. To keep up with modern design and 3D printers, Shapr3D developed the first mobile app for 3D computer-aided design (CAD). Commenting on the need for Shapr3D’s technology, the CEO and founder István Csanády said, “I came up with the idea for Shapr3D because I could see the urgent need for a 3D modeling application that is intuitive and easy to use on the move. I believe that if you are using a tool for 8-10 hours a day, it should fundamentally be better than what is on offer to designers today. We all want consumer-like apps at work, and sub-standard experiences just aren’t acceptable anymore. My generation, in particular, simply won’t tolerate bad software, and the CAD software world hasn’t changed in three decades.” It seems he was right, since Shapr3d has displayed significant and unique growth, spreading through word of mouth. Since Shapr3D’s launch on the Apple App Store in 2016 it has had over a million downloads. Its vast social media following is unusual for business software: more than 220,000 followers on Instagram and 40,000 on Facebook. All in all, Shapr3D is currently growing at 10 percent per month, over three times the average annual growth of the CAD modeling market. Christoph Janz, partner at Point Nine Capital, is a fan of the company and his kids are fans of the app: “One Shapr3D user told me this is the first time software has truly supported his creativity as opposed to standing in the way of it. Even my kids love playing with this app, which really is testament to just how easy it is to use and how much it opens up the market for design. The Shapr3D solution creates a new category of 3D design software and we are really happy to be working with the company, particularly as it is our first investment in Hungary.” Based in Budapest, Shapr3D will use this investment to open new offices in Europe, create new distribution channels, and grow its team to 100 people. Specifically the company hopes to hire a VP of marketing.',\n",
       " 'Madrid-based Smart Protection, an AI platform that combats online piracy and counterfeiting, has raised a €5.2 million Series A. The investment round, led by Nauta Capital, will help the business keep companies and their assets safe online. According to the International Trademark Association, global losses due to online piracy amounted to $760 billion in 2017, estimated to exceed $1.2 trillion in 2022. Smart Protection set out to police this activity for companies that own intellectual or industrial property rights, or that distribute content or products online. The modular SaaS platform adapts to the needs of each client, who decide which channels of the internet to monitor: search engines, online marketplaces, social networks, apps, P2P torrents, and download or counterfeit websites. The service begins by identifying a brand’s assets through monitoring the web with its data technology. Once data is collected, the platform combines machine learning with cybersecurity expertise to analyse the information and eliminate any infringements. SmartPlatform can remove links used for piracy or counterfeiting in a matter of hours, at over 95 percent efficacy. To date, the startup has delisted over 11 million hyperlinks on Google, for clients located in 18 countries, including big names such as Warner Bros Entertainment, Movistar+ and McAfee. Jordi Vinas, Nauta Capital’s General Partner said: “Smart Protection has developed a world-class technical platform able to take down illegal content from the internet efficiently — often surpassing competitors that have raised significant amounts of money. From our first interaction with the team, we were impressed with their track-record and stellar team, and we look forward to working together on the mission to make Smart Protection the go-to Anti-Piracy platform of the internet.” Commenting on how the funds will be used, the company’s CEO and co-founder Javier Perea said: “This partnership with Nauta will boost the development of our Artificial Intelligence technology, facilitate international expansion, and also allow us to recruit the best talent in order to build an increasingly secure internet.”',\n",

       " 'Munich-based PropTech startup Building Radar has raised €5 million in a Series A round, led by PropTech1 Ventures with support from coparion, FO Holding, and SIGNA innovations. Building Radar uses AI to do exactly what its name suggests: to identify new construction projects worldwide. The company aims to digitise the construction industry, which is growing fast in the founders’ home country of Germany. The only way for suppliers and service providers to capitalize on the booming construction industry is if they are aware of construction projects early on. Customer acquisition traditionally requires hours of manual research and reliance on word of mouth. Building Radar provides the technology for these companies to easily source new contracts and increase revenue potential. The software identifies 5,000 new construction projects a day from more than 100,000 different sources, covering more than 5 million construction sites. The user can search by location, construction phase or size, and can receive push notifications about every potential project. PropTech1 Ventures is Germany’s first VC fund dedicated to the PropTech sector. Commenting on the investment, Managing Partner Anja Rath said, “When it comes to digital innovations, the construction industry has enormous growth potential. Accordingly, we are pleased to invest in Building Radar, a PropTech that, with the help of artificial intelligence, frees suppliers in the construction industry from extremely idle manual processes at the sales level.” Leopold Neuerburg, Paul Indinger, and Raoul Friedrich founded the company in 2015. They will use the funds to expand into new markets, refine the search algorithm, and optimise machine-learning search results.']"

       "'Wayve, a UK startup applying artificial intelligence to mobile robotics, $20 million Series A round led by Eclipse Ventures, with participation from Balderton Capital, existing investors and several undisclosed preeminent leaders in machine learning and robotics. to launch a pilot fleet of autonomous vehicles in central London; self-driving cars are the company’s first commercial application of its technology. The company wants to power mobile robotics through AI and machine learning, rather than sensors and hand-coded rules. Co-founder and CEO Amar Shah explained, “As computational power and data continue to grow, learning-based approaches will become more inevitable, especially for mobile robotics. The human brain has evolved over millions of years, computers have only had a few decades, but are catching up quickly.” \\n\\nWith this approach to autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars could better navigate unfamiliar and difficult roads. In fact, this past spring, Wayve tested a self-driving car navigating on roads it had never been on before. The navigation was guided by cameras, a 2D map, and the startup’s end-to-end, deep learning “driving brain.”\\n\\n“The average human learns to drive in just 50 hours with visual input primarily. Once we have learned, we are capable at driving on roads around the world despite vastly differing traffic laws and cultural context,” said Suranga Chandratillake, partner at Balderton Capital. “Wayve’s self-driving technology is the closest to this human approach to learning. The great advantage of solving the problem this way is that it is robust in the face of a global opportunity.”\\n\\nNow the company will test its approach in one of the world’s busiest cities. Wayve will release a fleet of vehicles in central London for controlled trials; the start date was not disclosed.\\n\\nLaunched in Cambridge and currently based in London, Wayve reports it is the first European self-driving car company to snag a Silicon Valley VC to lead a Series A.\\n\\nSeth Winterroth, partner at Palo Alto-based Eclipse Ventures, commented: “Wayve’s differentiated approach to autonomy builds on timely advances in the fields of reinforcement learning, simulation and computer vision. Furthermore, by locating the company in the UK, the team has access to an extraordinary talent pool and numerous complex testing environments.”'"
